### 1 Prelude To A Turbuent Age
* 23 "(My 93-year-old mother has kept her subscription to the *Washington Post*
    stricly because she loves the corssword puzzles. I have shown her websites
    teeming with crossword puzzles, but she remains unmoved. My mother wants her
    bundle, and belongs to the last generation to do so.)
* 24 I'd been entrhralled by the astronomical growth in the volume of
    informationm but the truly epochal change, it turned out, was the revolution
    in the relationship between the *public* and *authority* in almost every
    domain of human activity.
* 24 Thoughtful interpretations of the genesis and nature of the change have
    been written by Yochai Benkler, Clay Shirky, and Glenn Reynolds, among manuy
    others.
* 25 First, the public. It's a singular noun for a plual object. I ussually
    refer to the public as "it," but sometimes, in a certain context, as "them."
    Whether one or the other is correct, I leave for grammarians to decide. Both
    fit.
* 28 It's early days. The transformation has barely begun, and resistance by the
    old order will make the consequences nonlinear, uncertain. But I think I
    have already established that we stand, everywhere, at the first moment of
    what promises to be a cataclysmic expansion of information and communication
    technology. Welcome, friend, to the Fifth Wave.

### 2 Hoder and Wael Ghonim
* 32 In theory, the Iranian regime is a Platonic republic, with wise guardians
    protecting the moral and material welfare of all. In practive, it resembles
    a sterile hybrid begot on the mafia by the Communist Party of the Soviet
    Union. he men in charge monopolize all the power and much of the wealth of
    the country. They claim to be revolutionary, and once really were, in the
    worst way. Decades ago, however, most of them settled into big mansions,
    bought expensive cars, and became an entrenched ruling class at home, while
    pursuing ancient Persian ambitions in the region and the world.
* 32 By 2000, he was in Canada. Because he wished to start a blog, he tinkered
    with code, and in September 2001 succeeded in adapting blogging software to
    the requirements of Farsi script.
* 33 Iranians took to blogging with abandon. At a time when Arab countries had
    only a handful of blogs almost all of them in English, Iran's "Blogistan"
    wuickly reached tens of thousands of active sites, and continues to grow to
    this day.
* 33 In consequence, the ruling class confronted what has come to be called "the
    dictator's dilemma" -a frequent affliction of authority in the new
    environment. The dilemma works this way: For security reasons, dictators
    must control and restrict communications to a minimum. To make their rule
    legitimate, however, they need prosperity, which can only be attained by the
    open exchange of information. Choose.
* 34 Whole swaths of Blogistan are thus dedicated to "conservative" political
    and religious views. High government figures are expected to communicate
    online. The most famuous blogger in the country is ex-president Ahmadinejad.
* 34 In a very nonlinear but, I believe, real way, all of these contortions had
    been forced on the brutal authoritarians of Iran by an insignificant young
    man tinkering with code in Toronto, Canada.
* 35 In February 2007, for exapmple, an Egyptian court condemned blogger Abdel
    Kareem Nabil Suleiman, who was all of 22 at the time, to four years in
    prison for "insulting the president" and "vilifying Islam."
* 36 A way forward into the mystery, then, would be to hypothesize that for
    Iran's rulers, Hoder--blogfather, blogger--stood for something larger and
    more threatening than himself. In fact, he stood for the loss of monopoly
    over information, the loss of an absolute control over public
    communications.
* 38 The classic case of insulting *corporate* sanctities involved the
    file-sharing program Napster. Shawn Fanning released the first version of
    Napster in June 1999. He was 18, an unknown teenager without money or
    business connections, yet the shock of that beta release would send the
    profits of a mighty industry on a downward spiral, from which it would never
    recover.
* 39 If Jack Valenti (head of Motion Picture Association of America) had had the
    power to sentence Shawn Fanning to 19.5 years in a federal penitentiary, I'm
    fairly certain he would have done so.
* 46 Roland Schatz, a brilliant commercial practitionaer of agenda-setting
    theory, has identified a level of media diffusion below which a message
    sinks without notice, but above which it quickly rises to public attention.
    Schatz calls this boundary the *awareness threshold*, and has estimated the
    tipping point at 15 percent of diffusion. Scholars have charted a similar
    trajectory for the adoption of every kind of innovation, including new
    political beliefs. "Critical mass" occurs at between 10 and 20 percent of
    adoption -- the level at which enough diffusion networks become "infected"
    by the virus of change to make the latter self-sustaining.
* 50 The reality of the new environment is that the golbal information sphere,
    rather than any one medium or platform, erupts into nearly very political
    conflict, and not infrequently helps determine the outcome. Unlike, say, TV
    or Facebook, the information spere can't be blocked by government. It's too
    redundant. Info leaks in anyhow.
* 50 This was demonstrated under almost lab conditions in Egypt on Friday, Jan
    28, 2011: the moment the government shut the door on its population's access
    to the internet. Mobile phone service was disrupted as well. Mubarak, on the
    brink of the precipice, wanted to change sides on the dictator's dilemma,
    withdraw his gamble on modernity. He imagined he could push Egypt back into
    the past, to the comfortable days before the Fifth Wave.
* 52 Its agents dropped Al Jazeera's signal from the Nilesate satellite, and
    orchestrated the physical intimidation of Al Jazeera staff in Egypt. These
    efforts collided with the redundancy factor and came to nothing. Other Arab
    channels offered Al Jazeera space on their satellites, and much of Al
    Jazeera's footage came from amateurs who could not be shut down or
    intimidated.
* 53 YouTube amplified this sentiment, re-hosting video from Al Jazeera and
    other broadcasters, as well as raw footage from cell phone cameras that
    somehow found a path to the web. Unlike TV or live streaing, YouTube could
    select the most visually dramatic moments, and make them searchable. It
    archived spontaneity: a defiant young man suddenly gunned down by security
    forces, a bizarre horse and camel charge by Mubarak supporters into the
    crowd at Tahrir Square.

### 3 My Thesis
* 57 But it turns out that fascination ith surface glitter has obscured our view
    to what is transpiring in the depths. There, human beings interact with
    platforms and information, ane are changed by the interaction, and the
    accumulated changes have shaken and battered established institutions from
    companies and universities to governments and religions.
* 58 My thesis is a simple one. We are caught between an old world that is
    decreasingly able to sustain us intellectually and spiritually, maybe even
    materially, and a new world that has not yet been born. Given the character
    of the forces of change, we may be stuck for decades in this ungainly
    posture. You who are young today may not live to see its resolution.
* 58 Each side in the struggle has a standard-bearer: *authority* for the old
    industrial scheme that has dominated globally for a century and a half, the
    *public* for the uncertain dispensation striving to become manifest. The
    conflict is so asymmetrical that is seems impossible for the two sides
    actually to engage. But they do engage, and the battlefield is everywhere.
* 58 The industrial age insisted on portentous-sounding names of great
    seriousness and formality, to validate the organizations that spoke with the
    voice of authority: "Bank of America," "National Broadcasting Corporation,"
    "*New York Times.*"
* 59 The digital age loves self-mocking names, which are a way to puncture the
    formal stiffness of the established order: "Yahoo!," "Google," "Twitter,"
    "Reddit, "Flickr," "Photobucket," "Bitcoin." I feel reasonable sure that
    the founders of Google never contemplated naming their company "National
    Search Engine Corporation" and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook never felt
    tempted by "Socia Connections Center of America." It wasn't the style.
* 60 Against this citadel of the status quo, the Fifth Wave has raised the
    *network*: that is, the public in revolt, those despised amateurs now
    connected to one another by means of digital devices.
* 62 Since power wasn't a file that could be copied or shared, the political
    battleground has tilted more in favor of hierarchy. Even the U.S government
    during this period has been allowed to operate on the assumption that the
    public are the enemy--for example, in airports and federal buildings.
* 69 In the tectonic depths of social and political life, the balance of power
    has fundamentally shifted between authority and obedience, ruler and ruled,
    elite and public, so that each can inflict damage on the other but neither
    can attain a decisive advantage. That is the non-utopian thesis of this
    book. And it was arrived at, in part, by pursuing threads of analysis about
    the nature and consequences of new media that were first spun by Clay
    Shirky.
* 76 A vast global information sphere, churning with controversies, points of
    view, and rival claims on every subject becomes accessible to our hero. Its
    volume and variety exceed that of the controlled media by many levels of
    magnitude. If *Homo Informaticus* were to try to absorb this mass, his head
    would explode. This is not what transpires. He will pick and choose. So will
    other members of the public. By that very selectivity, that freedom to
    choose its channels of information, the public breaks the power of the
    mediator class created by mass media, and, under authoritarian rule,
    controlled by the regime.
* 77 An accurate representation based on volume would show state media to be
    microscopic, invisible, when compared to the global information sphere. This
    is how *H. informaticus* experiences the changed environment: as an
    Amazonian flood of irreverent, controversy-ridden, anti-authority content,
    including direct criticism of the regime.

### 4 What The Public Is Not
* 87 Intoxicated by the successes of industrial organization the founders of
    mass movements, and their admirers and imitators, sought to reduce political
    action to pure mechanics. This was true of right and left, and regardless of
    the actual content of the movement's ideology. The latter was usualy a hash
    or pseudoscience, in any case: racial Darwinism for the Nazis, for example,
    or "scientific materialism" for Marxist-Leninists.
* 89 By the time the Soviet Union went out of business in 1991, the mass
    movement, in the eyes of its potential followers, had become a dead relic
    from a forgotten time. Desiccated specimens, which clung to places like Vube
    and North Korea, served as illustrations of its utter failure.
* 92 The relationship between the public and the crowd is not transparent.
    Though closely associated with on another, the two are never identical. The
    public, we know, is composed of private persons welded together by a point
    of reference: what Lippmann called an interest in an affair,which can mean a
    love of computer games or a political disposition.
* 92 A crowd, on the contrary, is always *manifest*, and capable of great
    physical destructiveness and ferocity. It is a form of action that submerges
    the desires of many individuals under a single rough-hewn will. In direct
    democracies like ancient Athens, it could be said to represent the will of
    the sovereign people. Everywhere else, the crowd can represent nothing.
* 95 In the new millenium, the public returned with a vengance, and its command
    of the information sphere permitted much greater intimacy with the crowd
    than had been structurally possible before. The public could invite itself
    to protest on Facebook comment from the streets on Twitter, and reflect on
    the larger meaning of the event on blogs, Tumblr, Reddit, and otheropen
    platforms. For the first time in history, public opinion could fuse, moment
    by moment, with the actions of the crowd.
* 97 In the worldwide political collision between the new public and established
    authority, the image of the crowd had assumed a decisive importance. A
    willingness to face down power, even to die, in front of cell phone cameras,
    has equalized the asymmetry of this conflict to a surprising extent.
* 97 The vector of contagion was the information sphere, the weapon of choice
    wasa the crowd. The resulting convulsion deserved a catchy name, but given
    the failure of the global imagination on this point, I will call it, simply,
    the year 2011.

### 5 Phase Change 2011
* 99 The elites who control the institutions have never really trusted the
    public, which they considered animalistic and prone to bouts of
    destructiveness. A glimpse at any American airport today will confirm that
    this horror of the top for the bottom has, if anything, grown more intense.
    + What has changed, then, is the public's distrust for authority - and its
        increased power, in the age of the Fifth Wave, to translate that
        distrust into action.
* 99 Pierre Rosanvallon, one of the few interesting political analysts today,
    has written of the "rise of *sociey of distrust.*" The public, in a complex
    society, must depend on specialist, experts, and intermediaries such as
    political representatives, organized institutionally and hierarchically.
    When the experts fail, the public can only appeal to other experts, often
    from the same failed institution. The process has resembled a mutual
    protection pact amoung elites. Failure typically gets blamed on insufficient
    support: the CIA, for example, demanded and received a bigger budget after
    9/11.
* 103 [quote from 2011 demonstrattions in Spain]: *Some of use consider
    ourselves more progressive, others more conservative. Some are believers,
    others not. Some have well-defined ideologies, others consider ourselves
    apolitical... But all of us are worries and outraged by the political,
    economic, and social landscape we see around us. By the corruption of the
    politicians, businessmen, bankers...*
* 104 Damming ideology and party politics attracted many to the protest. Sheer
    negation, hostility toward the status quo, became the shared point of
    reference for networks and individuals advocating mutually inconsistent
    ideals.
* 107 What should be the public's expectations of government? We know the
    *indignados*, along with millions of Spaniards, felt cheated of their
    expectations to the point of outrage and revolt. Were they justified?
* 108 But our answer also depends on the government's claims of competence over
    whole domains of activity - whether such claims are sincere and true,
    wishful thinking but false, or purely fraudulent. Once the public accepts
    the claims, an expectiation will have been formed, and failure to perform
    will appear like a breach of the social contract.
* 109 Leviathan is a massive but invertebrate monster. Add the separation of
    authorities normal to a parliamentary democracy, and you have, in the
    Spanish government, a babble of voices, a muddle of cross purposes, and a
    multitude of decision centers.
* 109 The protesters were correct to charge the two major parties with espousing
    identical princiciples and similar policies. Socialists and conservaties
    differed on marginal questions - Middle East policy, social affairs - but
    were of one mind on democracy, capitalism, the welfare state, the euro, and
    the E.U. In a hindsight clouded with failure and distrust, this looked like
    collusion, even corruption.
* 110 A visitor to Spain in 2007 could have watched on TV a government-sponsored
    commercial showing people literally hugging a tree, and another that
    featured two women kissing. In May 2006 the socialist party had proposed in
    parliament that certain "rights" be granted to four species of great apes.
    The tacit assumption the task of lifting the country to a higher ethical
    plane.
* 111 Under the conditions of the Fifth Wave, the human consequences of their
    failure couldn't be swept discreetly under the rug. The *indignados* were
    born on Facebook, and Twitter globalized their grievances. The economic
    crisis thus resembled a plane crash, a cataclusm out in the open, more than
    a problem in economics. THe government had nowhere to hids.
* 116 The who was plain enough. The protesters received support from the general
    public, and benefited from the active participation of some working-class
    elements - but this wasn't them. They did not represent the Israeli
    population or its proletariat. Nearly all the organizers and most of the
    demonstrators came from Tel Aviv's affluent, secular Ashkenazi families.
    THis was a revolt of middle-class hipsters, not of the downtrodden.
* 117 The left failed to insert any organizational strength or programmatic
    clarity into the protests. If leftists were abundant, the sectarian spirit
    of the people of the web was a far more powerful influence over the young
    rebels. Hence the carefree incoherence of their demands. To give just one
    example: proposals were floated to eliminate university tuition and increase
    benefits for the faculty.
* 121 I found strong demographic and behavioral affinities between Occupy Wall
    Street participants and the public that took to the streets in Egypt, Spain,
    and Israel. They were the same people, in different countries: young, middle
    class, university educated - and, in the case of OWS, predominatly white.
* 121 The organizers in New York and many other Occupy sites were,
    disproportionatey, ararchists. To a somewhat lesser extent, that had been
    the case in Spain as well.
* 122 The y spread the notion that the top 1 percent of Americans tyrannized the
    bottom 99 - and that they, a handful of white, middle-class youngsters,
    represented the vast American public, the people, in revolt.
* 122 The romance of condemnation, in my judgment, has become the most
    conspicuous feature of President Obama's mode of governance. The
    demonization of millionaires was a rhetorical pillar of the president's
    successful 2012 campaign.
* 123 When the media ignored the initial occupation, the organizers forgot their
    anti-consumerism and turned to a commercial public relations firm, Workhorse
    Publicity, for help with spreading the word of their revolution. The company
    did so well that it actually won a professional award for its efforts.
* 128 ...the White House, on October 16, proclaimed that President Obama was
    "working for the interests of the 99 percent."
* 130 *Everyone from all sides of London meet up at the heart of London
    (central) OXFORD CIRCUS!! Bare SHOPS are gonna get smashed up so come get
    some (free stuff!!!) fuck the feds we will send them back with OUR riot!>:O*
* 131 The perpetrators belonged to the same age group as the political rebels of
    2011... When asked why they looted, the most frequent response was: because
    they could. One participant flipped the question around: "Why are you
    going to waste the opportunity to get new stuff?"
* 131 Violence and criminality were not indiscriminate. They focused on specific
    objects: the police, stores specializing in digital products. They wnated
    the prestigious gadgets and entertainment which attended great affluence.
    But like the rebels in other democratic countries, they effected a strange
    mental separation between the life they wished for and the structures that
    made that life possible. This indirect method of self-destruction again
    raises the question of nihilism, about which I'll have more to say
    momentarily.
* 132 *The Home Affairs Select Committee has said that the single most important
    reason for the spread of the disorder was the perception, relayed by
    television as well as social media, that in some areas the police had lost
    control of the streets*. But loss of control wasn't a perception. It was the
    reality on the ground.
* 134 At virtually every protest described in this book, you found people
    wearing the Guy Fawkes mask popularized by the 2006 movie *V For Vendetta*.
    This was unique for would-be revolutionaries. I can't imagine Lenin or Mao
    or Castro allowing their comrades to impersonate a fictional character.
* 136 The mask was originally introduced to protest politics by the hacker group
    "Anonymous," which claimed for itself prodigious powers not unlike those of
    the protagonist in *V For Vendetta*. Anonymous can only be described as a
    mutant offspring of the Fifth Wave, spawned from the most nihilistic
    elements of the web, and it has played an uncartain part in the struggle
    between the public and authority... "We do it for the lulz."
* 138 Protesters there were affluent and employed, but expected the government
    to deliver personal fulfillment within a context of social justice. What
    that meant was never explained. Most of the Americal Occupiers also held
    down jobs. Conversely, those nearest to poverty never participated in any of
    the 2011 street revolts.
* 140 That was the most profound consequence of 2011: sowing the seeds of
    distrust in the democratic process... We still have time to discover that
    the street revolts in 2011, in V's words, did "change the world," and not in
    a good way.



## Brink Nation Book Club Docket
* 38 Shawn Fanning was 18 when first version of napster was released. Single
    handidly sent the music industry spiraling. I feel like if he didn't do it,
    someone else would have around the same time frame. I don't feel like this
    is the case with Satoshi.

* 121 WSO protesters were anarchists that "rejected capitalism"??? I thought
    anarchists were fans of capitalism, or is he using anarchy in a different
    way?
* 123 This quote is just too good on OWS: "When the media ignored the initial
    occupation, the organizers forgot their anti-consumerism and turned to a
    commercial public relations firm, Workhorse Publicity, for help with
    spreading the word of their revolution. The company did so well that it
    actually won a professional award for its efforts."
