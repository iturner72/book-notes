### 1 Prelude To A Turbuent Age
* 23 "(My 93-year-old mother has kept her subscription to the *Washington Post*
    stricly because she loves the corssword puzzles. I have shown her websites
    teeming with crossword puzzles, but she remains unmoved. My mother wants her
    bundle, and belongs to the last generation to do so.)
* 24 I'd been entrhralled by the astronomical growth in the volume of
    informationm but the truly epochal change, it turned out, was the revolution
    in the relationship between the *public* and *authority* in almost every
    domain of human activity.
* 24 Thoughtful interpretations of the genesis and nature of the change have
    been written by Yochai Benkler, Clay Shirky, and Glenn Reynolds, among manuy
    others.
* 25 First, the public. It's a singular noun for a plual object. I ussually
    refer to the public as "it," but sometimes, in a certain context, as "them."
    Whether one or the other is correct, I leave for grammarians to decide. Both
    fit.
* 28 It's early days. The transformation has barely begun, and resistance by the
    old order will make the consequences nonlinear, uncertain. But I think I
    have already established that we stand, everywhere, at the first moment of
    what promises to be a cataclysmic expansion of information and communication
    technology. Welcome, friend, to the Fifth Wave.

### 2 Hoder and Wael Ghonim
* 32 In theory, the Iranian regime is a Platonic republic, with wise guardians
    protecting the moral and material welfare of all. In practive, it resembles
    a sterile hybrid begot on the mafia by the Communist Party of the Soviet
    Union. he men in charge monopolize all the power and much of the wealth of
    the country. They claim to be revolutionary, and once really were, in the
    worst way. Decades ago, however, most of them settled into big mansions,
    bought expensive cars, and became an entrenched ruling class at home, while
    pursuing ancient Persian ambitions in the region and the world.
* 32 By 2000, he was in Canada. Because he wished to start a blog, he tinkered
    with code, and in September 2001 succeeded in adapting blogging software to
    the requirements of Farsi script.
* 33 Iranians took to blogging with abandon. At a time when Arab countries had
    only a handful of blogs almost all of them in English, Iran's "Blogistan"
    wuickly reached tens of thousands of active sites, and continues to grow to
    this day.
* 33 In consequence, the ruling class confronted what has come to be called "the
    dictator's dilemma" -a frequent affliction of authority in the new
    environment. The dilemma works this way: For security reasons, dictators
    must control and restrict communications to a minimum. To make their rule
    legitimate, however, they need prosperity, which can only be attained by the
    open exchange of information. Choose.
* 34 Whole swaths of Blogistan are thus dedicated to "conservative" political
    and religious views. High government figures are expected to communicate
    online. The most famuous blogger in the country is ex-president Ahmadinejad.
* 34 In a very nonlinear but, I believe, real way, all of these contortions had
    been forced on the brutal authoritarians of Iran by an insignificant young
    man tinkering with code in Toronto, Canada.
* 35 In February 2007, for exapmple, an Egyptian court condemned blogger Abdel
    Kareem Nabil Suleiman, who was all of 22 at the time, to four years in
    prison for "insulting the president" and "vilifying Islam."
* 36 A way forward into the mystery, then, would be to hypothesize that for
    Iran's rulers, Hoder--blogfather, blogger--stood for something larger and
    more threatening than himself. In fact, he stood for the loss of monopoly
    over information, the loss of an absolute control over public
    communications.
* 38 The classic case of insulting *corporate* sanctities involved the
    file-sharing program Napster. Shawn Fanning released the first version of
    Napster in June 1999. He was 18, an unknown teenager without money or
    business connections, yet the shock of that beta release would send the
    profits of a mighty industry on a downward spiral, from which it would never
    recover.
* 39 If Jack Valenti (head of Motion Picture Association of America) had had the
    power to sentence Shawn Fanning to 19.5 years in a federal penitentiary, I'm
    fairly certain he would have done so.
* 46 Roland Schatz, a brilliant commercial practitionaer of agenda-setting
    theory, has identified a level of media diffusion below which a message
    sinks without notice, but above which it quickly rises to public attention.
    Schatz calls this boundary the *awareness threshold*, and has estimated the
    tipping point at 15 percent of diffusion. Scholars have charted a similar
    trajectory for the adoption of every kind of innovation, including new
    political beliefs. "Critical mass" occurs at between 10 and 20 percent of
    adoption -- the level at which enough diffusion networks become "infected"
    by the virus of change to make the latter self-sustaining.
* 50 The reality of the new environment is that the golbal information sphere,
    rather than any one medium or platform, erupts into nearly very political
    conflict, and not infrequently helps determine the outcome. Unlike, say, TV
    or Facebook, the information spere can't be blocked by government. It's too
    redundant. Info leaks in anyhow.
* 50 This was demonstrated under almost lab conditions in Egypt on Friday, Jan
    28, 2011: the moment the government shut the door on its population's access
    to the internet. Mobile phone service was disrupted as well. Mubarak, on the
    brink of the precipice, wanted to change sides on the dictator's dilemma,
    withdraw his gamble on modernity. He imagined he could push Egypt back into
    the past, to the comfortable days before the Fifth Wave.
* 52 Its agents dropped Al Jazeera's signal from the Nilesate satellite, and
    orchestrated the physical intimidation of Al Jazeera staff in Egypt. These
    efforts collided with the redundancy factor and came to nothing. Other Arab
    channels offered Al Jazeera space on their satellites, and much of Al
    Jazeera's footage came from amateurs who could not be shut down or
    intimidated.
* 53 YouTube amplified this sentiment, re-hosting video from Al Jazeera and
    other broadcasters, as well as raw footage from cell phone cameras that
    somehow found a path to the web. Unlike TV or live streaing, YouTube could
    select the most visually dramatic moments, and make them searchable. It
    archived spontaneity: a defiant young man suddenly gunned down by security
    forces, a bizarre horse and camel charge by Mubarak supporters into the
    crowd at Tahrir Square.

### 3 My Thesis
* 57 But it turns out that fascination ith surface glitter has obscured our view
    to what is transpiring in the depths. There, human beings interact with
    platforms and information, ane are changed by the interaction, and the
    accumulated changes have shaken and battered established institutions from
    companies and universities to governments and religions.
* 58 My thesis is a simple one. We are caught between an old world that is
    decreasingly able to sustain us intellectually and spiritually, maybe even
    materially, and a new world that has not yet been born. Given the character
    of the forces of change, we may be stuck for decades in this ungainly
    posture. You who are young today may not live to see its resolution.
* 58 Each side in the struggle has a standard-bearer: *authority* for the old
    industrial scheme that has dominated globally for a century and a half, the
    *public* for the uncertain dispensation striving to become manifest. The
    conflict is so asymmetrical that is seems impossible for the two sides
    actually to engage. But they do engage, and the battlefield is everywhere.
* 58 The industrial age insisted on portentous-sounding names of great
    seriousness and formality, to validate the organizations that spoke with the
    voice of authority: "Bank of America," "National Broadcasting Corporation,"
    "*New York Times.*"
* 59 The digital age loves self-mocking names, which are a way to puncture the
    formal stiffness of the established order: "Yahoo!," "Google," "Twitter,"
    "Reddit, "Flickr," "Photobucket," "Bitcoin." I feel reasonable sure that
    the founders of Google never contemplated naming their company "National
    Search Engine Corporation" and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook never felt
    tempted by "Socia Connections Center of America." It wasn't the style.
* 60 Against this citadel of the status quo, the Fifth Wave has raised the
    *network*: that is, the public in revolt, those despised amateurs now
    connected to one another by means of digital devices.
* 62 Since power wasn't a file that could be copied or shared, the political
    battleground has tilted more in favor of hierarchy. Even the U.S government
    during this period has been allowed to operate on the assumption that the
    public are the enemy--for example, in airports and federal buildings.
* 69 In the tectonic depths of social and political life, the balance of power
    has fundamentally shifted between authority and obedience, ruler and ruled,
    elite and public, so that each can inflict damage on the other but neither
    can attain a decisive advantage. That is the non-utopian thesis of this
    book. And it was arrived at, in part, by pursuing threads of analysis about
    the nature and consequences of new media that were first spun by Clay
    Shirky.
* 76 A vast global information sphere, churning with controversies, points of
    view, and rival claims on every subject becomes accessible to our hero. Its
    volume and variety exceed that of the controlled media by many levels of
    magnitude. If *Homo Informaticus* were to try to absorb this mass, his head
    would explode. This is not what transpires. He will pick and choose. So will
    other members of the public. By that very selectivity, that freedom to
    choose its channels of information, the public breaks the power of the
    mediator class created by mass media, and, under authoritarian rule,
    controlled by the regime.
* 77 An accurate representation based on volume would show state media to be
    microscopic, invisible, when compared to the global information sphere. This
    is how *H. informaticus* experiences the changed environment: as an
    Amazonian flood of irreverent, controversy-ridden, anti-authority content,
    including direct criticism of the regime.

### 4 What The Public Is Not
* 87 Intoxicated by the successes of industrial organization the founders of
    mass movements, and their admirers and imitators, sought to reduce political
    action to pure mechanics. This was true of right and left, and regardless of
    the actual content of the movement's ideology. The latter was usualy a hash
    or pseudoscience, in any case: racial Darwinism for the Nazis, for example,
    or "scientific materialism" for Marxist-Leninists.
* 89 By the time the Soviet Union went out of business in 1991, the mass
    movement, in the eyes of its potential followers, had become a dead relic
    from a forgotten time. Desiccated specimens, which clung to places like Vube
    and North Korea, served as illustrations of its utter failure.
* 92 The relationship between the public and the crowd is not transparent.
    Though closely associated with on another, the two are never identical. The
    public, we know, is composed of private persons welded together by a point
    of reference: what Lippmann called an interest in an affair,which can mean a
    love of computer games or a political disposition.
* 92 A crowd, on the contrary, is always *manifest*, and capable of great
    physical destructiveness and ferocity. It is a form of action that submerges
    the desires of many individuals under a single rough-hewn will. In direct
    democracies like ancient Athens, it could be said to represent the will of
    the sovereign people. Everywhere else, the crowd can represent nothing.
* 95 In the new millenium, the public returned with a vengance, and its command
    of the information sphere permitted much greater intimacy with the crowd
    than had been structurally possible before. The public could invite itself
    to protest on Facebook comment from the streets on Twitter, and reflect on
    the larger meaning of the event on blogs, Tumblr, Reddit, and otheropen
    platforms. For the first time in history, public opinion could fuse, moment
    by moment, with the actions of the crowd.
* 97 In the worldwide political collision between the new public and established
    authority, the image of the crowd had assumed a decisive importance. A
    willingness to face down power, even to die, in front of cell phone cameras,
    has equalized the asymmetry of this conflict to a surprising extent.
* 97 The vector of contagion was the information sphere, the weapon of choice
    wasa the crowd. The resulting convulsion deserved a catchy name, but given
    the failure of the global imagination on this point, I will call it, simply,
    the year 2011.

### 5 Phase Change 2011
* 99 The elites who control the institutions have never really trusted the
    public, which they considered animalistic and prone to bouts of
    destructiveness. A glimpse at any American airport today will confirm that
    this horror of the top for the bottom has, if anything, grown more intense.
    + What has changed, then, is the public's distrust for authority - and its
        increased power, in the age of the Fifth Wave, to translate that
        distrust into action.
* 99 Pierre Rosanvallon, one of the few interesting political analysts today,
    has written of the "rise of *sociey of distrust.*" The public, in a complex
    society, must depend on specialist, experts, and intermediaries such as
    political representatives, organized institutionally and hierarchically.
    When the experts fail, the public can only appeal to other experts, often
    from the same failed institution. The process has resembled a mutual
    protection pact amoung elites. Failure typically gets blamed on insufficient
    support: the CIA, for example, demanded and received a bigger budget after
    9/11.
* 103 [quote from 2011 demonstrattions in Spain]: *Some of use consider
    ourselves more progressive, others more conservative. Some are believers,
    others not. Some have well-defined ideologies, others consider ourselves
    apolitical... But all of us are worries and outraged by the political,
    economic, and social landscape we see around us. By the corruption of the
    politicians, businessmen, bankers...*
* 104 Damming ideology and party politics attracted many to the protest. Sheer
    negation, hostility toward the status quo, became the shared point of
    reference for networks and individuals advocating mutually inconsistent
    ideals.
* 107 What should be the public's expectations of government? We know the
    *indignados*, along with millions of Spaniards, felt cheated of their
    expectations to the point of outrage and revolt. Were they justified?
* 108 But our answer also depends on the government's claims of competence over
    whole domains of activity - whether such claims are sincere and true,
    wishful thinking but false, or purely fraudulent. Once the public accepts
    the claims, an expectiation will have been formed, and failure to perform
    will appear like a breach of the social contract.
* 109 Leviathan is a massive but invertebrate monster. Add the separation of
    authorities normal to a parliamentary democracy, and you have, in the
    Spanish government, a babble of voices, a muddle of cross purposes, and a
    multitude of decision centers.
* 109 The protesters were correct to charge the two major parties with espousing
    identical princiciples and similar policies. Socialists and conservaties
    differed on marginal questions - Middle East policy, social affairs - but
    were of one mind on democracy, capitalism, the welfare state, the euro, and
    the E.U. In a hindsight clouded with failure and distrust, this looked like
    collusion, even corruption.
* 110 A visitor to Spain in 2007 could have watched on TV a government-sponsored
    commercial showing people literally hugging a tree, and another that
    featured two women kissing. In May 2006 the socialist party had proposed in
    parliament that certain "rights" be granted to four species of great apes.
    The tacit assumption the task of lifting the country to a higher ethical
    plane.
* 111 Under the conditions of the Fifth Wave, the human consequences of their
    failure couldn't be swept discreetly under the rug. The *indignados* were
    born on Facebook, and Twitter globalized their grievances. The economic
    crisis thus resembled a plane crash, a cataclusm out in the open, more than
    a problem in economics. THe government had nowhere to hids.
* 116 The who was plain enough. The protesters received support from the general
    public, and benefited from the active participation of some working-class
    elements - but this wasn't them. They did not represent the Israeli
    population or its proletariat. Nearly all the organizers and most of the
    demonstrators came from Tel Aviv's affluent, secular Ashkenazi families.
    THis was a revolt of middle-class hipsters, not of the downtrodden.
* 117 The left failed to insert any organizational strength or programmatic
    clarity into the protests. If leftists were abundant, the sectarian spirit
    of the people of the web was a far more powerful influence over the young
    rebels. Hence the carefree incoherence of their demands. To give just one
    example: proposals were floated to eliminate university tuition and increase
    benefits for the faculty.
* 121 I found strong demographic and behavioral affinities between Occupy Wall
    Street participants and the public that took to the streets in Egypt, Spain,
    and Israel. They were the same people, in different countries: young, middle
    class, university educated - and, in the case of OWS, predominatly white.
* 121 The organizers in New York and many other Occupy sites were,
    disproportionatey, ararchists. To a somewhat lesser extent, that had been
    the case in Spain as well.
* 122 The y spread the notion that the top 1 percent of Americans tyrannized the
    bottom 99 - and that they, a handful of white, middle-class youngsters,
    represented the vast American public, the people, in revolt.
* 122 The romance of condemnation, in my judgment, has become the most
    conspicuous feature of President Obama's mode of governance. The
    demonization of millionaires was a rhetorical pillar of the president's
    successful 2012 campaign.
* 123 When the media ignored the initial occupation, the organizers forgot their
    anti-consumerism and turned to a commercial public relations firm, Workhorse
    Publicity, for help with spreading the word of their revolution. The company
    did so well that it actually won a professional award for its efforts.
* 128 ...the White House, on October 16, proclaimed that President Obama was
    "working for the interests of the 99 percent."
* 130 *Everyone from all sides of London meet up at the heart of London
    (central) OXFORD CIRCUS!! Bare SHOPS are gonna get smashed up so come get
    some (free stuff!!!) fuck the feds we will send them back with OUR riot!>:O*
* 131 The perpetrators belonged to the same age group as the political rebels of
    2011... When asked why they looted, the most frequent response was: because
    they could. One participant flipped the question around: "Why are you
    going to waste the opportunity to get new stuff?"
* 131 Violence and criminality were not indiscriminate. They focused on specific
    objects: the police, stores specializing in digital products. They wnated
    the prestigious gadgets and entertainment which attended great affluence.
    But like the rebels in other democratic countries, they effected a strange
    mental separation between the life they wished for and the structures that
    made that life possible. This indirect method of self-destruction again
    raises the question of nihilism, about which I'll have more to say
    momentarily.
* 132 *The Home Affairs Select Committee has said that the single most important
    reason for the spread of the disorder was the perception, relayed by
    television as well as social media, that in some areas the police had lost
    control of the streets*. But loss of control wasn't a perception. It was the
    reality on the ground.
* 134 At virtually every protest described in this book, you found people
    wearing the Guy Fawkes mask popularized by the 2006 movie *V For Vendetta*.
    This was unique for would-be revolutionaries. I can't imagine Lenin or Mao
    or Castro allowing their comrades to impersonate a fictional character.
* 136 The mask was originally introduced to protest politics by the hacker group
    "Anonymous," which claimed for itself prodigious powers not unlike those of
    the protagonist in *V For Vendetta*. Anonymous can only be described as a
    mutant offspring of the Fifth Wave, spawned from the most nihilistic
    elements of the web, and it has played an uncartain part in the struggle
    between the public and authority... "We do it for the lulz."
* 138 Protesters there were affluent and employed, but expected the government
    to deliver personal fulfillment within a context of social justice. What
    that meant was never explained. Most of the Americal Occupiers also held
    down jobs. Conversely, those nearest to poverty never participated in any of
    the 2011 street revolts.
* 140 That was the most profound consequence of 2011: sowing the seeds of
    distrust in the democratic process... We still have time to discover that
    the street revolts in 2011, in V's words, did "change the world," and not in
    a good way.

### 6 A Crisis Of Authority
* 143 The street protests of 2011, while ostenibly political, were part of a
    global assault on the guardians of authority across every domain of human
    activity. The protesters stood in the same relation to government that
    bloggerts and social media did to newspapers, YouTube to television, Napster
    to the recording industry, massive online courses to universities, Amazon to
    shopping malls, the open-science movement to the scientific establishment.
    From the commanding heights of the information sphere, the public sought in
    3each case to break a monopoly held by an accredited elite.
* 143 An important social function of authority is to deliver certainty in an
    uncertain world. It explains reality in the context of the shared story of
    the group. For this is must rely on persuasion rather than compulsion, since
    naked force is a destroyer of trust and faith. The need to persuade in turn
    explains the institutional propensity for visible symbols of authority - the
    patrician's toga, the doctor's white frok, the financier's Armani suit.
* 143 Current structures of authority are a legacy of the industrial age. The
    public, when it needs answeres, turns to institutions rather than to
    charismatic individuals. These instititions have been subjected to a
    Taylorist process of rationalization: they are, without exception, top-down,
    specialized, professionalized, prone to pseudoscientific rituals and jargon.
    To enter such a precinct of authority requires a long and costly
    accreditation process - years of academic education and apprenticeship.
* 144 False consciousness can be invoked in a world in which the laws of
    history, and thus the shape of future events, are perfectly understood. Only
    then, with the tree of causation lucidly in mind, are we allowed to speak of
    the relation between a san conscious decision and reality as "true" or
    "false." But that is not the world we live in. That is not the human
    condition. Between every decision and its consequencers rised and
    impenetrable veil of uncertainty.
* 145 The gap, I maintain, was a function of the limits of human knowledge. It
    had always been there. What changed was the public's awareness of it.
* 148 In the century or so since Einstein's triumph, the practice of science has
    been transformed. Vast amounts of money have been poured into science and
    technology research and development: around $400 billion in the U.S. alone
    for 2009.
* 148 Consequently, the ideal of the lonely and disinterested seeker after truth
    has been superseded by that of the scientist-bureaucrat. Though the various
    fields of science differ greatly, scientific success, in general, has been
    difined less by the quality of the findings than by the ability to bring in
    "research support" - funding for the institution.
* 149 Much has been claimed for the scientific method, but the only method to
    which all scientists subscribe is the peer review process. It too has been
    under strain.
* 149 In extreme cases, this constriction of knowledge leads wo what one analyst
    has called "research cartels," which actively stifle minority or unorthodox
    views.
* 149 Since 1919, in sum, the practive of science migrated from the sectarian
    Border, where Einstein clearly originated, to a Cebter dominated by large,
    bureaucratic institutions.
* 149 The cost of scientific journals, for example, became prohibitive, so that
    only institutions could afford a subscription.
* 157 The risk commmision experts were convicted because they had been unwilling
    to admit, in public, to the degree of uncertainty that science imposed on
    them Theyt had been unwilling to saym, out in the open, "We don't know
    whether or not a major earthquake will strike L'Aquila in the short term."
* 158 If Pierre Rosanvallon's society of distrust had an official date of birth,
    it would be Mondaym, September 15, 2008: the day the Lehman Brothers
    investment bank, after a protracted agony, finally went bust.
* 159 In 1987, President Ronald Reagan appointed Greenspan chairman of the Board
    of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - a portentoous name for the
    central bank of the United States, usually called, without affection, "the
    Fed." By law, the mission of the Fes was, and still is, to maintain the
    stability of prices while promoting sustainable growth and full employment.
    The claims behind these goals possessed what I can only describe as a
    magical quality. They presupposed powers of prophecy and control wholly
    detached from exonomic reality.
* 160 Bob Woodward's 2000 biography of the Fed chairman was titled *Maestro*,
    evoking the image of a genius conductor, leading the economy to a flawless
    performance with a wave of his baton.
* 163 And so we circle back to 2008... Every institution in the system failed
    catastrophically, beginning with Greenspan's Fed, which encouraged a casino
    atmoshpere by flooding the markets with easy money. Investment firms like
    Lehman Brothers took that money and "leveraged" it, betting $30 for 3each
    dollar they actually held in their hands. The rating agencies like Moody's
    and Sandard and Poor's, designated by the government to assess investment
    risk, gave the complex, untested subprime securities a AAA rating: when all
    was said and done, Moody's had missed the mark by 20,000 percent. THe White
    House and Congress pumped the housing bubble by pressuring regulators to
    accept ever riskier mortgages.
* 170 Companies that cater to idiosyncratic tastes have flourished. The standard
    example is Amazon, with its vast inventory and :people like your" algorithm,
    although a host of online stores fits the bill as well. (The trajectory of
    the $1.4 trillion commercial web can serve as Exhibit A for the public's
    lack of interest in anti-capitalist jihad.)
* 172 *However, when the changes happen faster than expectations and/or
    institutions can adjust, the transition can be cataclysmic. Accelerating
    technology in the past decade has disrupted not just one secgtor but
    virtually all of them.*
* 172 Half the firms listed on the Fortune 500 in 1999 had dropped out by 2009.
    According to Richard Foster, the average lifespan of a company on the S&P
    500 has declined from 67 years in the 1920s to 15 years today.
* 177 Attempts have been made to replace ierarchy with "councils," and
    bureaucracy with a more networked approach. I don't know of any signal
    successes from these experiments, which run up against the spirit of
    bureaucracy - and, I suspect, against the grain of human nature.
* 179 Sicty years ago, Einstein spoke with the voice of God. Thirty years ago,
    Walter Cronkite every day told us "the way it is," and the *New York Times*
    delivered to our doorsteops "all the news that's fit to print." Twenty years
    ago, Alan Greenspan applied infallible formulas to ensure our prosperity.
    When I was a boy and factual disputes arose in my family, they were settled
    by consulting the *Encyclopedia Britannica*. Back then, the world of
    information was shaped like a pyramid. Those at the top decided signal from
    noise, knowlege from fraud, certainty from uncertainty. The public and mass
    media embraced this arrangement. All things being equal, authority was
    trusted and relied on.
* 179 Today we drown in data, yet thirst for meaning... According to Taleb, "The
    more data y0u get, the less you know what's goin on."
* 179 And the magisterial *Encyclopedia Britannica?* Gone the way of the dodo.
    Its place has been taken by Wikipedia, which, with its "edits" and "reverts"
    for many entries, leaves the reader uncertain about the agenda of any given
    version.

### 7 The Failure Of Government
* 186 The utopian ambition of governments from the industrial age, which sought
    to perfect the social order, hangs ridiculously, like an outsized suit of
    armor, on their feebler, latter-day heirs. Yet the quixotic pose has been
    maintained. The fiction of extraordinary ambition and mastery has persisted,
    without irony, in our political language.
* 186 For what it's worth, my purposes in this chapter are analytical rather
    than ideological. I have treated the limitation of overnment as a function
    of the limits of human knowledge, no of ideological preference, and in this
    approach I have stuck close to Paul Ormerod's brilliantly researched and
    happily titled book, *Why Most Things Fail*.
* 189 Because of his untimely death, President Kennedy never stood for
    re-election, but neither did he suffer the slightest political damage from
    the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The public in large numbers
    continues to trust the president. A Gallup poll taken two weeks after the
    incident have him an 82 percent approval rate, a 10 percent improvement over
    the previous poll. "The worse I do, the more popular I get," Kennedy joked.
* 190 In the months after his election, President Obama gave two major speeches
    on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the timulus package was
    formally known. One was a George Mason University, on January 9, 2009,
    before he was inagurated, and the second was before a joint session of
    Congress on February 24, after the bill had already been enacted into law.
* 191 The president's analysis of causes of the recession was strategic,
    far-reaching, and coherent. The crisis, "is largely of our own making" - a
    moral failure more than an economic downturn. "We have arrived at this point
    due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate
    boardrooms to the halls of power in Washington, D.C...
* 191 But the practical proposals to demonstrate this new spirit, as explained
    by the president, were all over the place. The stimulus bill was expected to
    jump-start the economy and "save or create" 3.5 million jobs, but it was
    also about promoting sustainable energy, repairing infrastructure, reforming
    our children's education, improving the competitiveness of the American
    worker, and delivering better health care to all.
* 191 Such programmatic fracturing has typified government action under the
    conditions of the Fifth Wave. The effect on the public has been to engender
    alarm and suspicion of hidden motives.
* 193 The ideals propelling Tea Partiers into action were wholly sectarian, that
    is to say, against: against Gig Government, high taxation, the deficit, the
    debt, Washington politics and politicians in general, and President Obama's
    legislation, like the stimulus  and the health-care plan, in particular.
* 203 The profound disconnect between talk and action gives the game away. The
    *aims* of democratic government have shifted, even if the language of
    politics has yet to catch up. High modernist government was an austere
    prophet, demanding the destruction of the muddled present to make room for
    the perfect future. Late modernist government is more like a kindly uncle,
    passing out chocolate chip coolies to his favorite nieces and nephews. He
    doesnb't wish to transform them. He just wants them to be happy - most
    particularly, with him.
* 204 Programs seem scarcely intelligible in terms of their stated purposes,
    and, like the stimulus, need to be legistlated at exhausting length.
    President Obama's signature program, the Patient Protection and Affordable
    Care Act, sprawled over 900 pages of contradictory minutia: the word
    "waiver" appeared 214 times. The Dodd-Frank bill, which tightened regulation
    of the U.S. financial system in 2010, covered 848 pages. For comparison, it
    took 31 pages in 1913 to establish the Federal Reserve, 37 to wrap up the
    Social Security Act of 1935.
* 209 In *Why Most Things Fail,* The heart of the matter, for Ormerod, was how
    closely an actor's *intention* matched up with the *results* of his action.
    His title gives the answer away. Ormerod found no obvious connection between
    the results of actions in a complex environment and their stated intentions.
* 212 *Humans, whether acting as individuals or making collective decisions in
    companies or governments, behave with purpose. They take decisions with the
    aim of achieving specific, desired outcomes. Yet our view of the world which
    is emerging is one in which it is either very difficult or even impossible
    to predict the consequences of decisions in any meaningful sense.*
* 220 Economic inequality, for example, has grown everywhere despite the best
    intentions of democratic governments. In the U.S., it increased under the
    Bush administration but worsened under President Obama's.

### 8 Nihilism And Democracy
* 225 In this late, tired age of democracy, large numbers of people believed
    that life was getting worse. The climate was changing for the worse - we had
    the Intergovernmnetal Panel on Climate Change to tell us that every year.
* 225 The economy was getting worse. For liberals, this belief justified
    continued intervention by the government. For conservatives, it justified
    attacking the president and his ambitious high modernist rhetoric.
* 225 Political life was getting worse. I listed multiple failures of democratic
    governments in the last chpter. These took place in the open, in full view
    of the public, and they were difficult to blame on a single person, party,
    or ideology. Failure seemed to be systemic.
* 232 A system that began by promising perfection had at last delivered
    nothingness. Governments were powerless, politics ere lost in the lobyrinth,
    democracy was a hollow ritual, a falsehood. Nothingness was the only
    reality, and it presided over nations. To strike at nothingness seemed at
    least lik *something*: a step forward, an intercession to be prayed for. So
    we were back to the cinematic nihilism of *V for Vendetta:* "With enough
    people, blowing up a building can change the world.
* 233 What is this uncanny beast, born of the Fifth Wave and now stalking into
    the uncertain future? The world of the nihilist does not belong to the
    nihilist. It belongs to the forces of selfishness and to repulsive people.
* 233 He considers his elected government to be a thing apart, and beneath
    contempt. That is the view from below. George W. Bush told him that the
    invasion of Iraq was about weapons of mass destruction, but none were found
    there. Barack Obama explained to him that the stimulus would cap
    unemployment, but millions more lost their jobs. Jose Luis Zapatero refused
    even to mention the word "crisis" to him, while economic disaster revaged
    Spain. I called these episodes failures of government, but that is not how
    the nihilist sees them. He thinks his rulers are liars and cheats, and he
    fills the web with angry rants on the subject.
* 235 He is morbidly, monstrously, *against*. He imagines he would be happy if
    the society in which he lives were wiped out tomorrow.
* 235 In the assembly of protesters, his is the loud, irreconcilable voice. In
    the peaceful demonstration, his is the hand heaving the Molotov cocktail
    through the shop window. In confrontation with police, he is eager to shed
    blood. In online forums, he is fertile with ideas to hack, expose, paralyze
    the institutions that run the world. He is the bomber, the random shooter: a
    terrorist without a cause.
* 235 The nihilist enefits prodigiously from the system he would like to smash.
    He's *not* marginalizedd - *not* a street person, *not* a forsaken soul,
    *not* a persecuted minority. He's not a sufferer in any sense, whether
    relative to historical standards or to the world today.
* 236 The mortal riddle posed by the nihilist is that he's a child of privilege.
    He's healthy, git, long-lived, university-educated, articulate, fashionably
    attired, widely traveled, well informed. He lives in his own place or at
    worst in his parents' home, never in a cave. He probably has a good job and
    he certainly has money in his pocket. In sum, he's the pampered poster boy
    of a system that labors desperately to make him happy, yet his feelings
    about his life, his country, democracy - the system - seethe with a virulent
    unhappiness.
* 243 Grant me, for the sake of argument, that history hasn't frozen solid - not
    entirely. WHat, then, of the conflict between the public and authority? It
    must erupt out of the depths and become personal. By this I mean that, in a
    world of ontingent outcomes, each of us will be faced with choices, and that
    our choices will come wrapped in a fatal question.

### 9 Choices And Systems
* 245 This chapter is more speculative and less analytical than the preciding
    ones. You stand warned. The reason for the change should be apparent. At
    some point, I needed to cash in my analysis. If the world is as I have
    described, *something* follows. Something must be done or changed or cut
    loose from out previous understanding. Otherwise, I have merely added my
    camel's straw to the vast weight of negation crushing democratic politics
    today.
* 246 In the reality interpreted by Ormerod, most things must fail, including
    ambitious government projects, because the world is too unpredictable and
    nonlinear. But if that is the case, what difference can a personal choice
    make? The intelligent reader will at once understand this to be another
    question entirely: In what social and political environment could *personal*
    choices make a difference? The search for an answer is a major thread in
    this chapter.
* 248 Only a generation ago, structural necessity dictated that hierarchy must
    grow steeper, more controlling, more efficient. THere were two political
    parties, two automakers, three TV networks, on newspaper for every city, all
    functioning with little energy and no input from below. The Taylorist spirit
    ruled. The top could command the bottom in minute detail.
* 250 The public, I mean to say, has been fully complicit in the failure of
    government. And the question of alternatives must extend beyond the formal
    organization of democracy to our expectations of what democratic government
    can deliver.
* 253 There is a second part to this choice. The standards used to eveluate
    government projects are also inventions of the industrial age. We, the
    public, are invited to take sides, to applaud or condemn presidents, based
    on some statistical abstraction, some *number* - the gross domestic product,
    for example, or unemployment and poverty rates. We saw the unemployment rate
    used like a baseball score in the controversy surrounding the stimulus. The
    number shows the public who's winning the political game.
* 253 Even if the unemployment rate measured the actual number of unemployed
    Americans - it doesn't - and even if I set aside the vexing question of
    whether the government should be responsible for employment, playing
    politics by the number is a frivolous game of make-believe. Politics is
    nothing like baseball. In the end, the most persuasive story wins, not the
    highest score. That is true whenever government tries to impose a specific
    outcome on a complex system. In the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, for example,
    the tally of dead American military personnel has been used as a surraget
    measure, but the success or failure of war policies have depended entirely
    on who wins the argument about the rightness of the cause. Abraham Lincoln,
    who oversaw the most horrific slaughter or U.S. troops in history, is today
    considered our greatest president.
* 255 The most consequential choices available under the conditions that prevail
    at the moment concern the public - you, me - and its political expectations.
    Such choices are grounded in tru contigency: I *can* align my expectations
    with reality or with utopian illusions. Nothing is settled. The power to
    decide is min (yours, ours).
* 256 Government also faces epochal choices. Heirarchy and bureaucracy, the
    expert and the trained professional, are losing favor with the public. The
    pyramid is shrinking: the distance between top and bottom has grown
    uncomfortably tight.
* 257 Firgue 29: Structural destiny: netwoek against hierarchy.
* 257 In a non-perfect world, which happens to be the one we live in,
    hierarchical government, democratic government, must find ways to regain
    legitimacy without yielding on every point to the negations of a networked
    public. The decisive choices, I believe, concern the handling of that
    perturning agent, information.
* 258 The USE.gove site, to take just one example, described itself as "The U.S.
    Government's official web portal." That sounded important and ambitious.
    Betweeen 2010 and 2011, however, the site garnered around 0.02 percent in
    "daily reach," or total traffic of the web - less than half the daily reach
    of Icanhascheezburger.com, a website featuring humorous photos of cats.
    Currently, the U.S. government's official web portal ranks 1,751 in
    popularity among U.S. websites, and 6,303 globally.
* 260 For government to communicate with the public online to any extent,
    official languae must be radically altered in style and length. That is also
    a choice, and by no means a trivial or superficial one.
* 260 When, like the stimulus, a law is 1,000 pages long, it becomes
    indigestible by the public. In fact, it is almost certainly indigestible to
    most of the elected representatives who vote on it - an instance of top-down
    ambition trumping the democratic process.
* 260 Brevity from government isn't a crazy dream. If our grandparents could
    deliver Social Security in 37 pages, we can produce much less consequential
    tax or budgetary decisions on a similar scale. It's the government's call.
* 262 The revolt of the public against authority can be framed as a contest
    between two disparate ways of looking at the world: the institutional and
    the practical. Institutions can perceive only generic abstractions, like the
    unemployment rate or the GDP. They are blind to the accumulation of detail
    that is everyday life.
* 263 I can still make bad decisions. In fact, I probably will - I can't ordain
    the future any more that Alan Greenspan or President Obama could. But my
    failure will redound on me, not on the government - and I will be able to
    apply practical knowledge immediately to repair my circumstances, rather
    than wait for action from remote and formulaic institutions. I will conduct
    my life with humility, according to trial and error, rather than double down
    on error and expect power to deliver success.

### 10 Finale For Skeptics
* 265 My thesis, again, is a simple one. The imformation technologies of the
    21st century have enabled the public, composed of amateurs, people from
    nowhere, to break the power of the political hierarchies of the industrial
    age. The result hasn't been a completed revolution in the manner of 1789 and
    1917, or utter collapse as in 1991, but more like the prolonged period of
    instability that preceded the settlement of Westphalia in 1648.
* 266 One large question remains. The skeptical reader has been asking it since
    the first chapter. How (the wonders) can he be sure that my thesis, with all
    that follows, is *right*? The answer is: he can't be sure. That's not how
    analysis works. In fact, that's not how human knowledge works. We can never
    know with certainty that any propositionf is right. We can only try to show
    that, so far, it hasn't been proven wrong. Analysts thrive on
    counterfactuals and falsification - or at least they should.
* 267 As an analyst, I must take the skeptic's question seriously. I must be an
    extreme skeptic myself. Since my thesis can never be shown to be completely
    right. I must take care to understand *where* and *how* it can be wrong.
* 268 The behavior of late modern government, too, counts as a first-level
    effect. Government today is slow to respond, afraid to advance, unwilling to
    yield. In democratic countries, it is habitually drawn into promising
    outcomes that it has no clue how to deliver. The public's conquest of the
    information sphere has left rulers dazed and confused.
* 271 At college, I took a class in Latin American social revolutions, taught by
    a professor who had just published a book on Chile. The professor had a
    mantra about the Chilean revolution. "The Marxist Allende government might
    not last," he said more than once, "but its reforms are irreversible." In
    his book, he had banished contingency from human events. He had fallen in
    love with the word *irreversible*. It was fall semester. That September, a
    week or so after the class began, Augusto Pinochet and the Chilean military
    overthrew Allende and the Marxists, and reversed all their reforms in as
    complete and permanent a fashion as history, which never stops, allows us to
    judge.
* 272 My poor professor's book suffered the academic equivalent of crib death. I
    learned a lesson - one that had nothing to do with Latin American social
    revolutions. I learned about the blindness of experts and the folly of
    prophecy. Years later, Philip Tetlock was to put scholarly integrity around
    this insight, in *Expert Political Judgment*. On reading Tetlock's data, I
    found myself fascinated but not in the least surprised.
* 279 History could well be driven by *negation* rather than contradiction. It
    could ride on the nihilistic rejection of the established order, regardless
    of alternatives or consequences. That would not be without precedent. The
    Roman Empire wasn't overthrown by something called "feudalism" - it
    collapsed of its own dead weight, to the astonishment of friend and foe
    alike. The centuries after the calamity lacked ideological form. Similarly,
    a history built on negation would be formless and nameless: a shadowy
    moment, however long, between on true age and another.
* 282 The federal government does a lot of things well. One of the things it
    does not do well," the president noted, "is information technology
    procurement."
* 283 Democracy isn't doomed. As an analyst, I have rejected prophecy and
    destiny as tools of the trade. I see the future with no greater clarity than
    you, reader. But processes at play *today*, right now, if continues, could
    well lead to the crumbling of what was always been a fragile system of
    government.
* 283 I wrote this book, in part, to invite the discussion. I did so in the
    manner of a man who noticed a fire blazing in the corner of a locked room: I
    don't want to start a panic, only some sane talk amoung the occupants about
    how best to put the thing out.

### Trump, Brexit, And Farewell To All That
* 286 Parallels were drawn between the U.S. today and the Weimar Republic, which
    spawned Adolf Hitler. Barack Obama, for one, took up the theme. Comparing
    the present moment to Hitler's "Vienna of the late 1920," the former
    president added ominously, "And then 60 million people died." In keeping
    with the temper of the times, the *Washington Post* devised a ne,
    appropriately apocalyptic motto: "Democracy Dies in Darkness." For many in
    politics and the news media, the darkness was already here.
* 287 The aim of this chapter is to extend my analysis to the events that caused
    such an uproar. Beyond the existential shock that Trump and Brexit
    represented, I must, at some level at least, come to grips with a world of
    troubles: the collapse of mainstream political parties in France and
    Germany, the failure of popular young leaders in Italy and Greece, the
    slow-motion crack-up of the European Union, the rise and fall of a
    blood-drenched "Caliphate" in the heart of the Levant, the viral dirfusion
    of terror and random slaughter. Then there's the vexing question of
    populism - a term that implies much more than it explains.
* 289 Among those viscerally hostile to Trump - above all the elites and the
    institutions, but also Democrats and the left generally, and some
    conservative intellectuals - his election was received as a moral and
    political impossibility, a malevolent absurdity that could only be explained
    in terms of lies and conspiracies, whose legitimacy must be rejected and
    "registered," without compromise, at all costs. Some called or members of
    the Electoral College pledged to Trump to vote for Clinton instead.
* 290 What in the world had happened? Or if you prefer: How is President Trump,
    disturber of the odds, object of so much fear and loathing, to be explained?
* 290 I said that Trump is free of any taint of governmnet or political
    experience. He's also ideologically formless - a member of his campaign
    staff described him, generously, as "post-idelogical." He has been for and
    against abortion in his time, for example. His supposed nationalism, on
    close inspection, dissolves into certain rhetorical preferences and the
    vague demand that the U.S. get better economic deals from the world.
* 292 In the 2016 Democratic primaries, more than 40 percent of the vote, and
    all the militant passion, went to Bernie Sanders - an old, white, dull,
    socialist Independent. Many of his supporters saw Clinton and other
    mainstream Democrats as cogs in a system they despised. ... In somewhat
    slower mothin than the Republicans, the Democratic Party is unbundling into
    dozens of political war-bands, each driven by the hunger for meaning and
    identity, all focused with monomaniacal intensity on a particular cause :
    feminism, the environment, anti-capitalism, pro-immigration, or racial or
    secual grievance. The schism has been veiled by the generalized loathing of
    all things Trump, but I find it hard to envision a national party thriving
    on tribalism and wars of identity.
* 292 In 1980, 1990, even 2000, Trump's bizarre trajectory would have beren not
    just impossible but politically suicidal. What has changed? The information
    balance of power has changed, of course. A generation ago, the public could
    exist only as a passive audience. Information was dispensed on the
    industrial model: top-down and one to many.
* 293 The facts are uncontroversial. Trump spent far less money on advertising
    than Clinton or his Republican opponents, yet he received a vastly greater
    volume of media coverage.
* 295 In that improbable year of 2016, Filipino voters raised to the presidency
    a populist that by comparison made Donald Trump sound like an etiquette
    book. Rodrigo Duterte bragged to the media that, as mayor of Manila, he had
    roamed the streets at night and personally shot drug dealers to death. So
    the new president of the Philippines was either a confessed murderer or, as
    now seems likely, a pathological liar. I bring up this weird story to jog
    our memories: the conflict that gave us Trump isn't uniquely American. The
    forces at play are global and secular.
* 298 The fate of Europe, like that of Britain, is slipping from the grasp of a
    purblind political class. The higher meaning of Brexit may be as an
    indicator of a great secular reversal. Globallu, institutions have entered a
    moment of decadence and disintegration - and the E.U. has been singularly
    afflicted.
* 299 In the 2017 electoral victories of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, many
    perceived a decisive reversal of this trend toward secession. THe Center was
    said to have conquered, and preserved the order, in the two largest E.U.
    nations. After Trump's election, desperate elites had crowned Merkel the new
    "leader of the free world." Macron inspired the same exaggerated enthusiasm-
    a cover of *The Economist* showed him literally walking on water.
* 204 Here I intend to stick to my question: whether the Putin authoritarian
    style, under current conditions of information - what I have called the
    Fifth Wave - has grown more powerful, threatening, or seductive, relative to
    the old democracies.




## Brink Nation Book Club Docket
* 38 Shawn Fanning was 18 when first version of napster was released. Single
    handidly sent the music industry spiraling. I feel like if he didn't do it,
    someone else would have around the same time frame. I don't feel like this
    is the case with Satoshi.

* 121 WSO protesters were anarchists that "rejected capitalism"??? I thought
    anarchists were fans of capitalism, or is he using anarchy in a different
    way?

* 123 This quote is just too good on OWS: "When the media ignored the initial
    occupation, the organizers forgot their anti-consumerism and turned to a
    commercial public relations firm, Workhorse Publicity, for help with
    spreading the word of their revolution. The company did so well that it
    actually won a professional award for its efforts."

* 262 Very nice synopsis of the core thesis of the book.

* 283 Based last line.
