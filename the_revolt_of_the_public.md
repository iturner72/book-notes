### Prelude To A Turbuent Age
* 23 "(My 93-year-old mother has kept her subscription to the *Washington Post*
    stricly because she loves the corssword puzzles. I have shown her websites
    teeming with crossword puzzles, but she remains unmoved. My mother wants her
    bundle, and belongs to the last generation to do so.)
* 24 I'd been entrhralled by the astronomical growth in the volume of
    informationm but the truly epochal change, it turned out, was the revolution
    in the relationship between the *public* and *authority* in almost every
    domain of human activity.
* 24 Thoughtful interpretations of the genesis and nature of the change have
    been written by Yochai Benkler, Clay Shirky, and Glenn Reynolds, among manuy
    others.
* 25 First, the public. It's a singular noun for a plual object. I ussually
    refer to the public as "it," but sometimes, in a certain context, as "them."
    Whether one or the other is correct, I leave for grammarians to decide. Both
    fit.
* 28 It's early days. The transformation has barely gegun, and resistance by the
    old order will make the consequences nonlinear, uncertain. But I think I
    have already established that we stand, everywhere, at the first moment of
    what promises to be a cataclysmic expansion of information and communication
    technology. Welcome, friend, to the Fifth Wave.

### Hoder and Wael Ghonim
* 32 In theory, the Iranian regime is a Platonic republic, with wise guardians
    protecting the moral and material welfare of all. In practive, it resembles
    a sterile hybrid begot on the mafia by the Communist Party of the Soviet
    Union. he men in charge monopolize all the power and much of the wealth of
    the country. They claim to be revolutionary, and once really were, in the
    worst way. Decades ago, however, most of them settled into big mansions,
    bought expensive cars, and became an entrenched ruling class at home, while
    pursuing ancient Persian ambitions in the region and the world.
* 32 By 2000, he was in Canada. Because he wished to start a blog, he tinkered
    with code, and in September 2001 succeeded in adapting blogging software to
    the requirements of Farsi script.
* 33 Iranians took to blogging with abandon. At a time when Arab countries had
    only a handful of blogs almost all of them in English, Iran's "Blogistan"
    wuickly reached tens of thousands of active sites, and continues to grow to
    this day.
* 33 In consequence, the ruling class confronted what has come to be called "the
    dictator's dilemma" -a frequent affliction of authority in the new
    environment. The dilemma works this way: For security reasons, dictators
    must control and restrict communications to a minimum. To make their rule
    legitimate, however, they need prosperity, which can only be attained by the
    open exchange of information. Choose.
* 34 Whole swaths of Blogistan are thus dedicated to "conservative" political
    and religious views. High government figures are expected to communicate
    online. The most famuous blogger in the country is ex-president Ahmadinejad.
* 34 In a very nonlinear but, I believe, real way, all of these contortions had
    been forced on the brutal authoritarians of Iran by an insignificant young
    man tinkering with code in Toronto, Canada.
* 35 In February 2007, for exapmple, an Egyptian court condemned blogger Abdel
    Kareem Nabil Suleiman, who was all of 22 at the time, to four years in
    prison for "insulting the president" and "vilifying Islam."
* 36 A way forward into the mystery, then, would be to hypothesize that for
    Iran's rulers, Hoder--blogfather, blogger--stood for something larger and
    more threatening than himself. In fact, he stood for the loss of monopoly
    over information, the loss of an absolute control over public
    communications.
* 38 The classic case of insulting *corporate* sanctities involved the
    file-sharing program Napster. Shawn Fanning released the first version of
    Napster in June 1999. He was 18, an unknown teenager without money or
    business connections, yet the shock of that beta release would send the
    profits of a mighty industry on a downward spiral, from which it would never
    recover.
* 39 If Jack Valenti (head of Motion Picture Association of America) had had the
    power to sentence Shawn Fanning to 19.5 years in a federal penitentiary, I'm
    fairly certain he would have done so.
* 46 Roland Schatz, a brilliant commercial practitionaer of agenda-setting
    theory, has identified a level of media diffusion below which a message
    sinks without notice, but above which it quickly rises to public attention.
    Schatz calls this boundary the *awareness threshold*, and has estimated the
    tipping point at 15 percent of diffusion. Scholars have charted a similar
    trajectory for the adoption of every kind of innovation, including new
    political beliefs. "Critical mass" occurs at between 10 and 20 percent of
    adoption -- the level at which enough diffusion networks become "infected"
    by the virus of change to make the latter self-sustaining.
* 50 The reality of the new environment is that the golbal information sphere,
    rather than any one medium or platform, erupts into nearly very political
    conflict, and not infrequently helps determine the outcome. Unlike, say, TV
    or Facebook, the information spere can't be blocked by government. It's too
    redundant. Info leaks in anyhow.
* 50 This was demonstrated under almost lab conditions in Egypt on Friday, Jan
    28, 2011: the moment the government shut the door on its population's access
    to the internet. Mobile phone service was disrupted as well. Mubarak, on the
    brink of the precipice, wanted to change sides on the dictator's dilemma,
    withdraw his gamble on modernity. He imagined he could push Egypt back into
    the past, to the comfortable days before the Fifth Wave.
* 52 Its agents dropped Al Jazeera's signal from the Nilesate satellite, and
    orchestrated the physical intimidation of Al Jazeera staff in Egypt. These
    efforts collided with the redundancy factor and came to nothing. Other Arab
    channels offered Al Jazeera space on their satellites, and much of Al
    Jazeera's footage came from amateurs who could not be shut down or
    intimidated.
* 53 YouTube amplified this sentiment, re-hosting video from Al Jazeera and
    other broadcasters, as well as raw footage from cell phone cameras that
    somehow found a path to the web. Unlike TV or live streaing, YouTube could
    select the most visually dramatic moments, and make them searchable. It
    archived spontaneity: a defiant young man suddenly gunned down by security
    forces, a bizarre horse and camel charge by Mubarak supporters into the
    crowd at Tahrir Square.
