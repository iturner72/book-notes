### The Network State in One Sentence
* 6 What is the Network State in one informal sentence: *A network state is a
highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that
crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic
recognition from pre-existing states.*
* 6 The Network State in One Sentence: *A network state is a social network with
a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a
capacity for collective action, an in person level of civility, an integrated
cryptocurrency, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual
capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income,
and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.*

### The Network State in One Thousand Words

* 8 The Network State in One Thousand Words
    * 8 Found a startup society.
    * Organize it into a group capable of collective action.
    * Build trust offline and a cryptoeconomy online.
    * Crowdfund physical nodes.
    * Digitally connect physical communities.
    * Conduct an on-chain census.
    * Gain diplomatic recognition.
* As the population and economy of a startup society grow comparable to that of
a legacy state, with millions of citizens and billions in income, it should
eventually be able to attain recognition from existing sovereigns -- and
ultimately the United Nations -- just as Bitcoin has now become a bona fide
national currency.

### The Network State in One Essay

* A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we describe a
peaceful, reproducible process for turning an online community premised on a
proposition into a physical state with a virtual capital: a *network state,*
the sequel to the nation state.
* 12 In the distant past people could only write on clay tablets, in the recent
past they were executed for contemplating entrepreneurship, and in the
immediate present they are arguing over replacing an ancient gas station. In
these times and places, making a fresh start has been technologically
infeasible, politically impossible, or judicially punishable.
* 12 Six ways to start a new country: Election, Revolution, War, Micronations,
Seasteading, Space, Network States.
* 15 *reverse diaspora*: a community that forms first on the internet, builds a
culture online, and only then comes together in-person to build dwellings and
structures.
* 16 The *numerical* definition begins with visualizing a hypothetical
nationrealestatepop.com site similar to coinmarketcap.com, which aggregates the
cryptographically audited censuses of startup societies aspiring to become
network states. This dashboard would show in realtime the number of community
members, the acreage of real estate owned by those members, and the community's
on-chain income.
* 17 The *societal* definition of a new country is one that is diplomatically
recognized by other countries as a legitimate polity capable of
self-determination.
* 18 Most countries are small countries. A new state with a population of 1-10M
would actually be comparable to most existing states. That's because of the 193
UN-recognized sovereign states, 20% have a population of less than 1M and 55%
have a population of less than 10M.

## Chapter 2: History as Trajectory

### Prologue
* 24 That is, many thousands of people are engaged full time in "offense
archaeology," the excavation of the recent and distant past for some useful
incident they can write up to further demoralize their political opposition.
This is the scholarly version of going through someone's old tweets. It's
weaponized history, history as opposition research. You simply can't win an
argument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need
history.
* 24 We denote the exponential improvement in transistor density over the
postwar period by Moore's law. We describe the exponential *decline* in
pharmaceutical R&D efficiency during the same period as Eroom's law -- as
Moore's law in reverse. That is, over the last several decades, the FDA somehow
presided over an enormous hike in the costs of drug development even as our
computers and our knowledge of the human genome vastly improved. Similar
phenomena can be observed in energy (where energy production has stagnated),
in aviation (where top speeds have topped out), and in construction (where we
build slower today than we did seventy years ago).
* 26 *History is the true value of cryptocurrency*. Bitcoin is worth hundreds
of billions of dollars because it's a cryptographically verifiable history of
who holds what BTC.
* 26 *History tells you who's in charge*. Why did Orwell say that he who
controls the past controls the future, and that he who controls the present
controls the past?
* 27 *History determines your hiring policy*. Why are tech companies being
lectured by media corporations on "diversity"? Is it because those media
corporations that are 20-30 points whiter than tech companies actually deeply
care about this? Or is it because after the 2009-era collapse of print media
revenue, media corporations struggled for a business model, found that certain
words drove traffic, and then doubled down on that - boosting their stock price
and bashing their competitors in the process?
* 27  ... the New York Times Company (which originates so many of these
jeremiads) is an organization where the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family
literally profited from slavery, blocked women from being publishers, excluded
gays from the newsroom for decades, ran a succession process featuring only
three cis straight white male cousins, and ended up with a publisher who just
happened to be the son of the previous guy.
* 33 While a political *consumer* has to pick one of a few party platforms off
the menu, a political *founder* can do something different: ideology
construction.
* 35 The One Commandment is also similar to tech in another respect: it
*focuses* a startup society on a single moral innovation, just like a tech
company is about a *focused* technoeconomic innovation.

### Microhistory and Macrohistory
* 38 In the bottom-up view, history is written to the ledger. If everything
that happened gets faithfully recorded, history is then just the analysis of
the log files.
* 39 ...history is a *cryptic epic of twisting trajectories*. Cryptic, because
the narrators are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic, because
the timescales are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your own
experience and beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because
there are curves, cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And
trajectories, because history is ultimately about the time evolution of human
beings, which maps to the physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of
particles progressing through time.
* 40 *Microhistory* is the history of a reproducible system, one which has few
enough variables that it can be reset and replayed from the beginning in a
series of controlled experiments.
* 41 At a surface level, the Kalman flter resembles the kind of time series
analysis that's common in finance. The key difference is that the Kalman filter
is used on *reproducible* systems while finance is typically a *non-
reproducible* system.
* 42 *Macrohistory* is the history of a non-reproducible system, one which has
too many variables to easily be reset and replayed from the beginning. It is
history that is not directly amenable to controlled experiment.
* 45 So, how could someone in the future (or even the present) know if a
particular event they didn't directly observe was real? The Bitcoin blockchain
gives one answer. It is the most rigorous form of history yet known to man, a
history that is technically and economically resistant to revision. Thanks to a
combination of cryptographic primitives and financial incentives, it is very
challenging to falsify the who, what, and when of transactions written to the
Bitcoin blockchain.
* 46 In a little more detail, *why* is the Bitcoin blockchain so resistant to
the rewriting of history? To falsify the "who" of a single transaction you'd
need to fake a digital signature, to falsify the "when" you'd need to corrupt a
timestamp, and you'd need to do this while somehow not breaking all the other
records cryptographically connected to that transaction through the mechanism
of composed block headers.
* 46 Some call the Bitcoin blockchain a *timechain* because unlike many other
blockchains, its proof-of-work mechanism and difficulty adjustment ensure a
statistically regular time interval between blocks, crucial to its function as
a digital history.
* 47 ...the Bitcoin blockchain gives a *history that's hard to falsify*. Unless
there's an advance in quantum computing, a breakthrough in pure math, a
heretofore unseen bug in the code, or a highly expensive 51% attack that
probably only China could muster, it is essentially infeasible to rewrite the
history of the Bitcoin blockchain--or anything written to it. And even if such
an event *does* happen, it wouldn't be an instantaneous burning of Bitcoin's
Library of Alexandria. The hash function could be replaced with a quantum-safe
version, or another chain robust to said attack could take Bitcoin's place, and
back up the ledger of all historical Bitcoin transactions to a new protocol.
* 47 Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD as the year 13 AS, with
"After Satoshi" as the new "Anno Domini," and the block clock as the new
universal time.
* 49 As noted, the full scope of what the Bitcoin blockchain represents is
nothing less than the history of an entire economy. Every transaction is
recorded since *t*=0. Every fraction of a BTC is accounted for, down to one
hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Nothing is lost.
* 51 We can now see how the expansion of blockspace is on track to give us a
*cryptographically verifiable macrohistory*, or cryptohistory for short. This
is the log of everything that billions of people choose to make public: every
decentralized tweet, every public donation, every birth and death certificate,
every marriage and citizenship record, every crypto domain registration, every
merger and acquisition of an on-chain entity, every financial statement, every
public records -- all digitally signed, timestamped, and hashed in freely
available public ledgers.
* 52 We call this indelible, computable, digital, authenticatable history the
*ledger of record*.

### Political Power and Technological Truth
* 55 *Political mascot model: history is written by winners pretending to be
acting on behalf of losers*. This is a variant of the political determinist
model, also known as "offense archaeology," and practiced by the modern
American, Chinese, and Russian establishments -- all of whom portray
themselves as victims.
* 57 One of the most time-honored techniques to mobilize public animosity
against the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This
technique, says Professor Lasswell, has been used "with unvarying success in
every conflict known to man."
* 57 Coming from a different vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a
"founding murder." Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat
toned-down versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to
justify expansions of political power.
    * If we don't force people to take off their shoes at the airport, people
will die!
    * If we don't stop people from voluntarily taking experimental curative
drugs, people will die!
    * If we don't set up a disinformation office to stop people from making
hostile comments online, people will die!
* 58 Often this completely ignores the death caused by that force itself. For
example, when the FDA "prevented" deaths by cracking down on drug approvals
after thalidmide, it caused many more deaths via Eroom's Law and drug lag.
* 58 And sometimes the atrocity story is just completely fake; before Iraq was
falsely accused of holding WMD, it was falsely accused of tossing babies from
incubators.
* 58 ...just as the atrocity story is a tool for political power, unfortunately
so too is genocide denial -- as we can see from The New York Times' Pulitzer-
winning coverup of Stalin's Ukrainian famine.
* 59 *Technological determinist model: technology is the driving force of
history* ...Hundreds of years later, we don't care that much about the laws of
Isaac Newton's time, but we do care about Newton's laws.
* 61 *Helix model: linear and cyclical history can coexist*...which says that
from one viewpoint history is indeed progressive, from another it's genuinely
cyclical, and the reconciliation is that we move a bit forward technologically
with each turn of the corkscrew rather than collapsing.
* 62 *Ozymandias model: civilization can collapse*. History shows us that
technological progress is not inevitable. The Fall of Civilizations podcast
really makes this clear. Gobekli Tepe is one example.
* 64 *Idea Maze model: those who overfit to history will never invent the
future*. This is the counterargument to the Train Crash model -- past results
may not predict future performance, and sometimes you need to have a beginner's
mindset to innovate. Generally this works better for opt-in technologies and
investments than top-down modifications of society like communism.
* 65 *idea maze*...The relevant bit here is that just because a business
proposition didn't work in the past doesn't necessarily mean it won't work
today. The technological and social prerequisites may have dramatically
changed, and doors previously closed may now have opened.
* 67 History is the entire record of everything humanity has done. It's a very
rich data structure tht we have only begun to even think of *as* a data
structure.
* 69 Once you reluctantly recognize that not *every* aspect of a sociopolitical
order can be derived from an objective calculation, and that some things really
*do* depend on an arbitrary consensus, you realize that we need to maintain a
balance between political power and technological truth.
    * We have a political theory of history that says "social and political
incentives favor the propagation of politically useful narratives."
    * We have a technological theory of history that says "financial and
technical incentives favor the propagation of technological truths."
    * We have a set of examples that show how politically powerful actors were
constrained by decentralizing technology.
    * We have more examples that show that some facts really are determined by
societal consensus, while others are amenable to decentralized verification.
    * And we understand why groups need both to survive; the backwards will be
beaten, while the unpopular will never have political power in the first place.

### God, State, Network

* 73 Many progressive atheists are by no means astatists; they worship the
State as if it were God. And many libertarian atheists may not believe in
either God *or* the State, but they do believe in the Network - whether that be
their social network or their cryptocurrency.
* 74 The full global displacement of God by the State (something already
clearly underway in France since 1789) led to the giant wars of the 20th
century, Democratic Capitalism vs Nazism vs Communism. These new faiths
replaced g-o-d with g-o-v, faiths which centered the State over God as the most
powerful force on earth.
* 75 Put another way, what's the most powerful force on earth? In the 1800s,
God. In the 1900s, the US military. And by the mid-2000s, encryption. Because
as Assange put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math
problems. So it doesn't matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property
or information is secured by cryptography, the state can't seize it without
getting the solution to an equation.
* 76 It's about using encryption and crypto to protect freedom of speech,
freedom of association, freedom of contract, prevention from discrimination
*and* cancellation via pseudonymity, individual privacy, and truly equal
protection under rule-of-code--even as the State's paper-based guarantees of
the same become ever more hollow.
