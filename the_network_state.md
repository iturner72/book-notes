highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that
crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic
recognition from pre-existing states.*
* 6 The Network State in One Sentence: *A network state is a social network with
a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a
capacity for collective action, an in person level of civility, an integrated
cryptocurrency, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual
capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income,
and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.*

national currency.

### The Network State in One Essay

* A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we describe a
peaceful, reproducible process for turning an online community premised on a
proposition into a physical state with a virtual capital: a *network state,*
the sequel to the nation state.
* 12 In the distant past people could only write on clay tablets, in the recent
past they were executed for contemplating entrepreneurship, and in the
immediate present they are arguing over replacing an ancient gas station. In
these times and places, making a fresh start has been technologically
infeasible, politically impossible, or judicially punishable.
* 12 Six ways to start a new country: Election, Revolution, War, Micronations,
Seasteading, Space, Network States.
* 15 *reverse diaspora*: a community that forms first on the internet, builds a
culture online, and only then comes together in-person to build dwellings and
structures.
* 16 The *numerical* definition begins with visualizing a hypothetical
nationrealestatepop.com site similar to coinmarketcap.com, which aggregates the
cryptographically audited censuses of startup societies aspiring to become
network states. This dashboard would show in realtime the number of community
members, the acreage of real estate owned by those members, and the community's
on-chain income.
* 17 The *societal* definition of a new country is one that is diplomatically
recognized by other countries as a legitimate polity capable of
self-determination.
* 18 Most countries are small countries. A new state with a population of 1-10M
would actually be comparable to most existing states. That's because of the 193
UN-recognized sovereign states, 20% have a population of less than 1M and 55%
have a population of less than 10M.
