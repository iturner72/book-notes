### The Network State in One Sentence
* 6 What is the Network State in one informal sentence: *A network state is a
highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that
crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic
recognition from pre-existing states.*
* 6 The Network State in One Sentence: *A network state is a social network with
a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a
capacity for collective action, an in person level of civility, an integrated
cryptocurrency, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual
capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income,
and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.*

### The Network State in One Thousand Words

* 8 The Network State in One Thousand Words
    * 8 Found a startup society.
    * Organize it into a group capable of collective action.
    * Build trust offline and a cryptoeconomy online.
    * Crowdfund physical nodes.
    * Digitally connect physical communities.
    * Conduct an on-chain census.
    * Gain diplomatic recognition.
* As the population and economy of a startup society grow comparable to that of
a legacy state, with millions of citizens and billions in income, it should
eventually be able to attain recognition from existing sovereigns -- and
ultimately the United Nations -- just as Bitcoin has now become a bona fide
national currency.

### The Network State in One Essay

* A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we describe a
peaceful, reproducible process for turning an online community premised on a
proposition into a physical state with a virtual capital: a *network state,*
the sequel to the nation state.
* 12 In the distant past people could only write on clay tablets, in the recent
past they were executed for contemplating entrepreneurship, and in the
immediate present they are arguing over replacing an ancient gas station. In
these times and places, making a fresh start has been technologically
infeasible, politically impossible, or judicially punishable.
* 12 Six ways to start a new country: Election, Revolution, War, Micronations,
Seasteading, Space, Network States.
* 15 *reverse diaspora*: a community that forms first on the internet, builds a
culture online, and only then comes together in-person to build dwellings and
structures.
* 16 The *numerical* definition begins with visualizing a hypothetical
nationrealestatepop.com site similar to coinmarketcap.com, which aggregates the
cryptographically audited censuses of startup societies aspiring to become
network states. This dashboard would show in realtime the number of community
members, the acreage of real estate owned by those members, and the community's
on-chain income.
* 17 The *societal* definition of a new country is one that is diplomatically
recognized by other countries as a legitimate polity capable of
self-determination.
* 18 Most countries are small countries. A new state with a population of 1-10M
would actually be comparable to most existing states. That's because of the 193
UN-recognized sovereign states, 20% have a population of less than 1M and 55%
have a population of less than 10M.

## Chapter 2: History as Trajectory

### Prologue
* 24 That is, many thousands of people are engaged full time in "offense
archaeology," the excavation of the recent and distant past for some useful
incident they can write up to further demoralize their political opposition.
This is the scholarly version of going through someone's old tweets. It's
weaponized history, history as opposition research. You simply can't win an
argument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need
history.
* 24 We denote the exponential improvement in transistor density over the
postwar period by Moore's law. We describe the exponential *decline* in
pharmaceutical R&D efficiency during the same period as Eroom's law -- as
Moore's law in reverse. That is, over the last several decades, the FDA somehow
presided over an enormous hike in the costs of drug development even as our
computers and our knowledge of the human genome vastly improved. Similar
phenomena can be observed in energy (where energy production has stagnated),
in aviation (where top speeds have topped out), and in construction (where we
build slower today than we did seventy years ago).
* 26 *History is the true value of cryptocurrency*. Bitcoin is worth hundreds
of billions of dollars because it's a cryptographically verifiable history of
who holds what BTC.
* 26 *History tells you who's in charge*. Why did Orwell say that he who
controls the past controls the future, and that he who controls the present
controls the past?
* 27 *History determines your hiring policy*. Why are tech companies being
lectured by media corporations on "diversity"? Is it because those media
corporations that are 20-30 points whiter than tech companies actually deeply
care about this? Or is it because after the 2009-era collapse of print media
revenue, media corporations struggled for a business model, found that certain
words drove traffic, and then doubled down on that - boosting their stock price
and bashing their competitors in the process?
* 27  ... the New York Times Company (which originates so many of these
jeremiads) is an organization where the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family
literally profited from slavery, blocked women from being publishers, excluded
gays from the newsroom for decades, ran a succession process featuring only
three cis straight white male cousins, and ended up with a publisher who just
happened to be the son of the previous guy.
* 33 While a political *consumer* has to pick one of a few party platforms off
the menu, a political *founder* can do something different: ideology
construction.
* 35 The One Commandment is also similar to tech in another respect: it
*focuses* a startup society on a single moral innovation, just like a tech
company is about a *focused* technoeconomic innovation.

### Microhistory and Macrohistory
* 38 In the bottom-up view, history is written to the ledger. If everything
that happened gets faithfully recorded, history is then just the analysis of
the log files.
* 39 ...history is a *cryptic epic of twisting trajectories*. Cryptic, because
the narrators are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic, because
the timescales are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your own
experience and beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because
there are curves, cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And
trajectories, because history is ultimately about the time evolution of human
beings, which maps to the physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of
particles progressing through time.
* 40 *Microhistory* is the history of a reproducible system, one which has few
enough variables that it can be reset and replayed from the beginning in a
series of controlled experiments.
* 41 At a surface level, the Kalman flter resembles the kind of time series
analysis that's common in finance. The key difference is that the Kalman filter
is used on *reproducible* systems while finance is typically a *non-
reproducible* system.
* 42 *Macrohistory* is the history of a non-reproducible system, one which has
too many variables to easily be reset and replayed from the beginning. It is
history that is not directly amenable to controlled experiment.
* 45 So, how could someone in the future (or even the present) know if a
particular event they didn't directly observe was real? The Bitcoin blockchain
gives one answer. It is the most rigorous form of history yet known to man, a
history that is technically and economically resistant to revision. Thanks to a
combination of cryptographic primitives and financial incentives, it is very
challenging to falsify the who, what, and when of transactions written to the
Bitcoin blockchain.
* 46 In a little more detail, *why* is the Bitcoin blockchain so resistant to
the rewriting of history? To falsify the "who" of a single transaction you'd
need to fake a digital signature, to falsify the "when" you'd need to corrupt a
timestamp, and you'd need to do this while somehow not breaking all the other
records cryptographically connected to that transaction through the mechanism
of composed block headers.
* 46 Some call the Bitcoin blockchain a *timechain* because unlike many other
blockchains, its proof-of-work mechanism and difficulty adjustment ensure a
statistically regular time interval between blocks, crucial to its function as
a digital history.
* 47 ...the Bitcoin blockchain gives a *history that's hard to falsify*. Unless
there's an advance in quantum computing, a breakthrough in pure math, a
heretofore unseen bug in the code, or a highly expensive 51% attack that
probably only China could muster, it is essentially infeasible to rewrite the
history of the Bitcoin blockchain--or anything written to it. And even if such
an event *does* happen, it wouldn't be an instantaneous burning of Bitcoin's
Library of Alexandria. The hash function could be replaced with a quantum-safe
version, or another chain robust to said attack could take Bitcoin's place, and
back up the ledger of all historical Bitcoin transactions to a new protocol.
* 47 Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD as the year 13 AS, with
"After Satoshi" as the new "Anno Domini," and the block clock as the new
universal time.
* 49 As noted, the full scope of what the Bitcoin blockchain represents is
nothing less than the history of an entire economy. Every transaction is
recorded since *t*=0. Every fraction of a BTC is accounted for, down to one
hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Nothing is lost.
* 51 We can now see how the expansion of blockspace is on track to give us a
*cryptographically verifiable macrohistory*, or cryptohistory for short. This
is the log of everything that billions of people choose to make public: every
decentralized tweet, every public donation, every birth and death certificate,
every marriage and citizenship record, every crypto domain registration, every
merger and acquisition of an on-chain entity, every financial statement, every
public records -- all digitally signed, timestamped, and hashed in freely
available public ledgers.
* 52 We call this indelible, computable, digital, authenticatable history the
*ledger of record*.

### Political Power and Technological Truth
* 55 *Political mascot model: history is written by winners pretending to be
acting on behalf of losers*. This is a variant of the political determinist
model, also known as "offense archaeology," and practiced by the modern
American, Chinese, and Russian establishments -- all of whom portray
themselves as victims.
* 57 One of the most time-honored techniques to mobilize public animosity
against the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This
technique, says Professor Lasswell, has been used "with unvarying success in
every conflict known to man."
* 57 Coming from a different vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a
"founding murder." Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat
toned-down versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to
justify expansions of political power.
    * If we don't force people to take off their shoes at the airport, people
will die!
    * If we don't stop people from voluntarily taking experimental curative
drugs, people will die!
    * If we don't set up a disinformation office to stop people from making
hostile comments online, people will die!
* 58 Often this completely ignores the death caused by that force itself. For
example, when the FDA "prevented" deaths by cracking down on drug approvals
after thalidmide, it caused many more deaths via Eroom's Law and drug lag.
* 58 And sometimes the atrocity story is just completely fake; before Iraq was
falsely accused of holding WMD, it was falsely accused of tossing babies from
incubators.
* 58 ...just as the atrocity story is a tool for political power, unfortunately
so too is genocide denial -- as we can see from The New York Times' Pulitzer-
winning coverup of Stalin's Ukrainian famine.
* 59 *Technological determinist model: technology is the driving force of
history* ...Hundreds of years later, we don't care that much about the laws of
Isaac Newton's time, but we do care about Newton's laws.
* 61 *Helix model: linear and cyclical history can coexist*...which says that
from one viewpoint history is indeed progressive, from another it's genuinely
cyclical, and the reconciliation is that we move a bit forward technologically
with each turn of the corkscrew rather than collapsing.
* 62 *Ozymandias model: civilization can collapse*. History shows us that
technological progress is not inevitable. The Fall of Civilizations podcast
really makes this clear. Gobekli Tepe is one example.
* 64 *Idea Maze model: those who overfit to history will never invent the
future*. This is the counterargument to the Train Crash model -- past results
may not predict future performance, and sometimes you need to have a beginner's
mindset to innovate. Generally this works better for opt-in technologies and
investments than top-down modifications of society like communism.
* 65 *idea maze*...The relevant bit here is that just because a business
proposition didn't work in the past doesn't necessarily mean it won't work
today. The technological and social prerequisites may have dramatically
changed, and doors previously closed may now have opened.
* 67 History is the entire record of everything humanity has done. It's a very
rich data structure tht we have only begun to even think of *as* a data
structure.
* 69 Once you reluctantly recognize that not *every* aspect of a sociopolitical
order can be derived from an objective calculation, and that some things really
*do* depend on an arbitrary consensus, you realize that we need to maintain a
balance between political power and technological truth.
    * We have a political theory of history that says "social and political
incentives favor the propagation of politically useful narratives."
    * We have a technological theory of history that says "financial and
technical incentives favor the propagation of technological truths."
    * We have a set of examples that show how politically powerful actors were
constrained by decentralizing technology.
    * We have more examples that show that some facts really are determined by
societal consensus, while others are amenable to decentralized verification.
    * And we understand why groups need both to survive; the backwards will be
beaten, while the unpopular will never have political power in the first place.

### God, State, Network

* 73 Many progressive atheists are by no means astatists; they worship the
State as if it were God. And many libertarian atheists may not believe in
either God *or* the State, but they do believe in the Network - whether that be
their social network or their cryptocurrency.
* 74 The full global displacement of God by the State (something already
clearly underway in France since 1789) led to the giant wars of the 20th
century, Democratic Capitalism vs Nazism vs Communism. These new faiths
replaced g-o-d with g-o-v, faiths which centered the State over God as the most
powerful force on earth.
* 75 Put another way, what's the most powerful force on earth? In the 1800s,
God. In the 1900s, the US military. And by the mid-2000s, encryption. Because
as Assange put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math
problems. So it doesn't matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property
or information is secured by cryptography, the state can't seize it without
getting the solution to an equation.
* 75 It's about using encryption and crypto to protect freedom of speech,
freedom of association, freedom of contract, prevention from discrimination
*and* cancellation via pseudonymity, individual privacy, and truly equal
protection under rule-of-code--even as the State's paper-based guarantees of
the same become ever more hollow.
* 75 The Network is the Next Leviathan
    * *1. Encryption > State Violence* When there is strong encryption government
can't crack, that means communications states can't eavesdrop on, transactions
they can't intercept, and digital borders they can't penetrate.
    * *2. Cryptoeconomy > Fiat Economy* ...Bitcoin being money the State can't
easily freeze, seize, ban, or print. In theory this is just a special case of
the point on encryption, but its implications are broad: all manner of
financial instuments, corporate vehicles, accounting, payroll, and the like can
be done on-chain outside the control of states.
    * *3. Peer-to-Peer > State Media* There are two kinds of state media:
state-controlled media as in China's Xinhuanet, or state-*control* media as in
America's The New York Times. The latter controls the state, the former is
controlled by the state, but both fight freedom of speech. Network-facilitated
P2P communication is anathema to them, particularly if end-to-end encrypted.
    * *4. Social > National* When the network identity is more salient than
the neighor relationship, it challenges the very premise of the Westphalian
state, which is that (a) people who live geographically near each other share
values and (b) therefore laws should be based on geographic boundaries. The
alternative is that only people who are *goedesically* near each other in the
social network share values, and therefore the laws that govern them should be
based on network boundaries.
    * *5. Mobile > Sessile* Mobile is making us more mobile. And law is a
function of latitude and longitude; as you change your location, you change the
local, state, and federal laws that apply to you.
    * *6. Virtual Reality > Physical Proximity* As a complement to mobile, the
Network offers another way to opt out od State-controlled physical
surroundings: namely, to put on a VR (or AR) headset, at which point you are in
a completely different world with different people surrounding you and
different laws.
    * *7. Remote > In-person* The concept of the nework state as a division of
the world by people rather than by land is particularly important here, as
network states are natively built for getting voluntary subscription revenue
from people around the world. The diaspora *is* the state.
    * *8. International > National* The Network gives people more of a *choice*
over what specific State they are subject to. For example, they can move a
server hosting their website from country to country with a few clicks.
    * *9.Smart Contracts > Law* We're still in the early days of smart
contracts, but as we get well-debugged and formally-verified contract
libraries, this is an area where the Network is poised to take over from the
State. Imagine truly international law: it's done programmatically rather than
via pieces of paper, across borders outside the domain of legacy states, and by
global technologists rather than country-specific lawyers.
    * *10. Cryptographic Verification > Official Confirmation* Perhaps the most
important arena in which the Network is stronger than the state is in the
nature of truth itself. It's the ultimate triumph of the technological trooth
view of history as there are now technical *and* financial incentives for
passing down true facts, regardless of the sociopolitical advantages any given
government might have for suppressing them. To foreshadow a bit, this *ledger
of record* is history written by the Network rather than the State.
* 79 As mentioned before, Uber and Lyft are better regulators than the State's
paper-based taxi medallions, email is superior to the USPS, and SpaceX is out-
executing NASA...if you care about toe US census, the Network gives a real-time
survey which is far more up to date than the State's 10 year process.
* 79 Applying the "Network > State" formulation to recent events, think about
January 2021, when -- at the behest of the New Tork Times Company and all of
mainstream media -- Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter combined to
deplatform a sitting president and disappear his supporters' app from the
internet. This was undeniable proof of the US government's impotence, because
the "most powerful man in the world" was clearly no longer even the most
powerful man in his own country.
* 80 Some exaplles of "State > Network" include Ross Ulbricht's arrest by the
US government, the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, China's
crackdown on cryptocurrency, the European Union's GDPR regulation, the COVID
lockdowns that inhibited any digital nomad's ability to exit, the rising number
of government internet shutdowns, and the US establishment's push to censor the
internet.
* 81 Let's review a few cases of particular importance:
    * *1. SF city government > Bay Area tech founders.* Despite how competent the
tech founders of SF were on the Network, the political billionairs of the San
Francisco city government managed to use their control of the State to turn the
city into a hellhole.
    * *2. CCP > Chinese tech founders.* China had its own establishment-driven
techlash. The huge cost of pausing of the massive Alibaba IPO on some
regulatory pretense was a signal. The CCP-controlled Chinese State beat the
international Network of Chinese tech founders.
    * *3. Biasing AI with AI Bias* The fundamental concept is about asserting
moral control over a technological field. AI "ethics" doesn't really contest
what is true or false, it contests what is good and bad. And what is bad?
Anything that advances a politically unfavorable narrative. As a concrete
example, in 2021, Ukraine was widely reported to be a corrupt country full of
Azov Battalion Nazis. By mid 2022, those reports would have been reclassified
as "disinformation" and pushed down to page 10 of the search results, if the AI
bias people had their way.
    * *4. Digital Deplatforming* ...in the West, if you say something the
regime doesn't like on Twitter, your post disappears, and possibly your
account, and--in American protectorates like the UK--maybe you're brought in
for "tea" by the security forces.
* 88 One important synthesis that deserves special mention is the
"Network/God": a Network God, and AI God, a GPT-9 or DALL∙E 10 that gives
instant, superhuman answers to difficult questions using the knowledge of all
of humanity.
* 88 AI could be tuned and trained on particular corpora rather than the
general web. What would Jesus do (WWJD), in an app? What would Lee Kuan Yew do?
What would David Ben-Gurion do? What would George Washington do?
* 91 The NSA won't need to hack its way in, it's get a front door. And then it
will likely get hacked in turn, spraying all of your data over the internet.
* 91 As a preview, that's where the One Commandment comes in. The concept is
that you don't want or need to start an entirely new religion to build a
startup society, but you *do* need a moral innovation of some kind.

### People of God, People of the State, People of the Network
* 94 Stereotypically, the peopple of God offer thoughts and prayers, the people
of the State say "there oughta be a law!", and the people of the Network write
some code.
* 94 They gray tribe is the easiest to analyze. It is fair to say that they are
primarily people of the Network Leviathan. These technological progressives are
not just atheists, they are also *astatists*, as they do not typically believe
in either God or the State. They are genuinely internationalists in a way
neither red nationalists nor blue faux internationalists are, as they don't
subscribe to American exceptionalism, and interact with people from other
countries through the Network as equals.
* 95 Blue Tribe: Left-Authoritarians, Left-Libertarians
    * The blue tribe is the most powerful in Western society today, and has
two main internal factions: the left-authoritarians who worship the State, and
the left-libertarians who are (unconsciously) people of the Network.
* 96 Wokeness is a Doctrine, not a Religion
    * "a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party,
or other group."
    * Each doctrine has a Leviathan, a most powerful force. And a religion is
then just a type of doctrine.
    * Wokeness *does* have cognates to many aspects of Christianity -- we all
have the Calvinist original sin of bigotry, we're going to the warm hell of
climate change unless we repent, unbelievers must "recant," heresy must be
suppressed, the West's beliefs must be evangelized at gunpoint, and so on.
* 97 Blue State: Left-Authoritarians
    * For the left-authoritarians among the blues, their primary Leviathan is
the State, which is very real and can do violence against its/their enemies, as
opposed to what they think of as an imaginary God.
    * This is why State-worshippers mock the concept of "thoughts and prayers"
in favor of "passing a law."
    * This is also why left-authoritarians tend to take for granted that all
ills can be solved by "praying for relief" to the State, by forming some
agency, by appropriating ever mor money. Taxes are secular tithes, and the
Gov-fearing man is like the God-fearing man -- you simply cannot pay enough
money and respect to the state, because as the DNC video says outright,
"government is the one thing we all belong to." It's not about results, it's
about fealty.
* 98 Even thought they culturally love the State and hate the Network, it's
important to not that the left-authoritarians in the US *have* managed to
recently take control of big chunks of the Network, through placing
sympathizers in key positions at Big Tech companies during the techlash and
Great Awokening of the 2010s. (There are incipient signs of pushback here,
though, at places like Netflix and even Google, where the very wokest are
being terminated.)
* 98 What do left-authoritarians generally look like from an occupational
standpoint? The body of left-authoritarians are the NPCs paying the NYT
monthly subscriptions for the official "truth," slavishly turning their heads
with every new software update, insisting that masks don't work before they do,
reliably surging behind the current thing. These are just foot soldiers, but
interestingly the most important left-authoritarians aren't the alected
officials.
* 99 ...we call it NYT/USD, to emphasize their source of truth and digital
economy relative to BTC/web3 and CCP/RMB.
* 99 Go read the descriptions of the prizes they award to each other, and
you'll see them celebrate themselves for making something that was previously
volitional newly mandatory or forbidden. "Our report led to government action!"
Whether that action was the bombing of Libya or the banning of plastic straws
makes no nevermind; impact is impact.
* 99 Laws aren't the only form of impact. Hetting someone fired is too. We
talk of hit pieces and calcel culture as if they're aberrations, but they're
actualy the core of left-authoritarian culture. Recall that the most
prestigious thing any establishment journalist ever did was Watergate: namely,
getting a president fired while selling millions of copies of their newspaper.
* 100 After Watergate, the left-authoritarians knew that they were the boss of
the boss, that they could get the president fired, that they could "hold
someone accountable" -- and, conversely, that no one could really hold *them*
accountable in any way. For example, what was the punishment for printing the
"disinformation" that led to, say, the Iraq War, or the Holodomor? Suspension
from social media? Reparations for the dead? Or nothing? Much easier to pin it
all on a single Nixon, or even a Stalin for that matter, than a decentralized
mass of nameless left-authoritarians.
* 101 The Soviets had a state-controlled press, but America now had a
press-controlled state.
* 103 ...an important insight is that behind many of these left-authoritarian
journalists (and activists and nonprofits) is an old-money zillionaire, a
nepotistic heir of some kind. You won't find someone at The Atlantic
criticizing Laurene Powell Jobs, you won't find someone at NPR going after
Soros, and you won't find someone at The New York Times Company that even
publicly *admits* that their boss, Arthus Gregg Sulzberger, is a rich white
male neoptist.
* 103 There is a split among ble Americans. Some of them, the left-
libertarians, are actually best modeled as people of the Network -- meaning,
the social network, They truly aren't primarily loyal to the Democrat party or
even the institutions that are upstream of it, but to their community online --
which increasingly diverges from the party line.
* 105 The three-legged stool of Reaganism -- the religious conservatives, the
secular nationalists, and the internationalist capitalists -- side with the
God, State, and Network Leviathans respectively.
* 107 Red State: Secular Nationalists
    * These are the national security hawks, the people who may not like the
left-authoritarians but who will nevertheless reflexively support the US in
every foreign intervention.
    * ...after all, they aren't vurning their own country down! -- but
unfortunately, on foreign policy they are helping to burn down *other*
people's countries, and often for no good reason.
* 110 It's really crucial to understand that the US establishment is *not*
more ethical than the CCP when it comes to civil liberties. It's just less
competent!
* 112 Red Network: Internationalist Capitalists
    * We identify them as people of the Network. Today that kind of capitalism
is almost synonymous with internet startups and technology. The most valuable
companies in the world were born on the Network. And the future of network
capitalism is crypto-capitalism, because it's not just rransactions that can
be represented on-chain -- it's entire financial statements, and companies
themselves, and eventually the entire economy.
    * On balance, I'm sympathetic to this group as well, but it has its own
internal issues. For one thing, Bitcoin Maximalism in particular is similar to
Woke Capital in its fundamentalism.
* 112 Red State vs Red Network
    * ...in the event of any conflict between the Network and the State, such
as a possible struggle between the inflating dollar and the deflationary
Bitcoin, the right-statists could take the side of the national flag while the
right-capitalists take the side of the digital currency.
    * If we add up all these pieces, we get a possible future where the left-
and right-libertarians from both parties line up against the left- and
right-authoritarians.
* 117 You can think of the "people of the Network" as technological
progressives, and the "people of the State" as political progressives
(charitably) or technologica conservatives (perhaps more realistically).
* 117 ...the people of the Network start by thinking about getting a *piece of
the network* to call their own. A domain name, something they can build up from
scratch, starting with a bare website like reddit.com and ending up with a
massive online destination that everyone voluntarily seeks out. The primary
goal of the technological progressive, the tech founder is to build -- and for
no one to have power over them.
* 120 ...there *was* a period from roughly 1933-1970 when the centralized US
gvernment did the Hoover Dam, the Manhattan Project, and Apollo. The transistor
and early internet came out of this era as well. And there were some later
innovations also catalyzed by the State (albeit often by non-bureaucrats who
managed to commandeer bureaucrat funds) like the Humane Genome Project and the
self-driving car.
* 120 ...it's also true for the period *before* the (well-intentioned)
Vannevar Bush memo that kicked off the government centralization of science.
After all, most of physics -- from Newton to Maxwell to Einstein -- was
discovered before the National Science Foundation (NSF) was even created.
* 121 ...it's true that there was a period mid-century where all other actors
besides the US and USSR were squashed down and centralized states dominated
innovation. But it's not because they were necessarily better at *innovating*,
it's because they were better at *dominating*, due to the centralized tech of
that time. It was more about the Enormous State than the Entrepreneurial State.
And that's why the technological progressives of the Network don't reflexively
genuflect before the political progressives of the State.
* 123 ...as Ray Dalio has noted, things may not stay flat in historical terms
for long. As such, the blue and red statists may be in for a rude shock. Using
the lens of the Leviathans, they really think their God, the State, can never
fail.

### If the News is Fake, Imagine History
* 126 If the News Fake, Imagine History
    * Remember the "oops" on the Iraq War, after the media corporations that
were supposed to "hold the government accountable" instead helped justify the
invasion of Iraq under false pretenses?
    * Remember the thousands of reports on "Russiagate" that completely
disappeared after the Mueller report?
    * Remember when the NYT said Hillary Clinton had a 91% chance to win,
giving the strong impression that the 2016 election wasn't even close?
    * Remember when they said YouTube's remaining freedom of speech was a bad
thing in the US, and then praised its freedom of speech the next day when it
was helpful in getting their content into Russia?
    * Remember when Kara Swisher reported that innocent high school student
Nick Sandmann had done something wrong for merely standing still in front of a
man who strode up to him pounding a drum?
    * Remember when Kara Swisher's Recode also said COVID-19 was "contained,"
before it ended up killing more than a million Americans?
    * Remember all the official disinformation on COVID, how they called people
racists for warning about it, and said that masks didn't work before they did?
    * Remember when everone switched sides on vaccines, and everything else
related to COVID, as Michael Solana ably chronicled here?
    * Remember when the US establishment published reports credulously
predicting that inflation would be transitory?
    * And remember when there was minimal mainstream coverage of the 2017
battle for Mosul, the world's largest military operation since the invasion of
Iraq in 2003, the war that Obama was supposed to have ended?
* 128 In each of these cases, we have something predicted to go to zero that
ends up at millions, or certainty that winds up a nullity, or a hot war
featuring the US military and 482 suicide car bombings that somehow registered
on the public consciousness as zero.
* 128 *Channel distortion*. That which favors the US establishment is magnified
100X, while that which disfavors it is downranked 100X or silenced entirely,
such that the net distortion is 10,000X or more. We can think of this as
analogous to *channel distortion* in signal processing. Megia corporations
aren't just censors, they're *sensors* - and self-interested ones.
* 129 *Narrative alignment*. The way the establishment determines what to put
on the front page out of millions of possible stories should remind you of the
political power theory of history. It's only things that support the narrative:
their favored state policies will always succed, thir disfavored tech
competitors will always fail, their errors are hoest mistakes, your errors are
firing offenses, the opponents of the establishment are x-ists and traitors,
free speech is the enemy, and so on.
* 129 *Power over truth*. In these incidents, if you stop to count, you often
realize that the reports were off not by say 50%, but by 1000X or more. Why do
these "reporters" still have their jobs, then? Because their job wasn't to
make money, but to make power.
* 132 ...in the 1990s and 2000s, the American establishment could seem to eat
its cake and have it too -- enjoying the rhetorical windfall of claiming to
have a free society, while in practice holding an enormous distribution
advantage over the common man ("never argue with a man who buys ink by the
barrel").
* 132 The Establishment Launched the Counter-Decentralization
    * ...in 2013, the techlas plus the Great Awokening, by what Jack Bratich
calls a "war of restoration" by an establishment that had been economically
disrupted by the Network but that retained the capability to morally denounce
its enemies.
    * Their rivals were basically everyone -- tech, Trump, China, Russia,
Israel, Brazil, Hungary, Brexiteers, Macron -- everyone that wasn't a loyal
part of the US establishment's social network.
    * America's establishment spent down huge amounts of reputation, but they
managed to wokify Google, Amazon, Apple, and the major tech companies,
deplatform Trump and get him out of office, and terrorize the country with
massive riots.
* 134 Here are some quick links that may surprise you about the past:
    * In 1958, President Nasser of Egypt laughed at the idea that Egyptian
women would eber be forced to wear the *hijab*. Surprise: the Muslim world was
far more secular within livnig memory.
    * AferWorld War 2, Operation Paperclip put reformed German scientists to
work on the American space program. Surprise: the real *Hidden Figures* were
Nazis.
    * Germany sponsored Vladimir Lenin, and bankers in New York funded Leon
Trotsky to foment the Russian Revolution. Surprise: the Russian Revolution
wasn't done wholly by Russians.
    * The Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns The New York Times Company, owned
slaves but didn't report that fact in ther 1619 coverage.
    * New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for
helping the Soviet Union starve Ukraine into submission, 90 years before the
Times decided to instead "stand with Ukraine."
    * Herbert Matthews, also a New York Times correspondent, helped Castro win
power in Cuba, leading the murderous Cuban revolution and the subsequent Cuban
missile crisis that almost resulted in nuclear war.
    * Another American "journalist," Edgar Snow, wrote books such as *Red Star
Over China* that praised Chairman Mao to the havens before, during, and after
Mao embarked on programs of mass murder and collectivization.
    * The "liverating" Soviet Red Army raped its way across Eastern Europe in
the 1940s, the same communists that The Times extolled as giving women a
"better sex life" in its 2017 anniversary series on the Russian Revolution.
* 139 More than 20 years ago, *Reason Magazine* ran a story that still holds up
well today, called *Hollywood's Missing Movies*, about how the film industry
airbrushed the drama of the Cold War out of the 20th century. So it's not just
that the movie industry ran positive prtrayals of US establishment journalists,
they also ran positive portrayals of out-and-out communitsts.
* 141 Some reading on techno-economic history:
    * patrickcollison.com/fast - how fast construction once was.
    * wtfhappenedin1971.com - how many economic indicators went off track in
1971, around the time the US got off the gold standard.
    * J Storrs Hall: *Where's My Flying Car?* - how the world used to be on an
icreasing energy production curve till the regulatory varrier of the 1970s.
    * Matt Ridley: *How Innovation Works* - how tech founders always had to
fight against the establishment, much like the present day.
    * William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson: *The Sovereign Individual* -
how the centralized power of the 20th century is actually historically
aberrant.
    * Ray Dalio: *Principles of the Changing Economic Order* - how today's
America resembles the Dutch and British empires of the past in terms of its
monetary overextension.
    * Peter Turchin: *Ware and Peace and War* - how quantitative methods can
identify recurrent cycles.
    * William Straus and Neil Howe: *The Fourth Turning* - how a cyclic theory
of history forecasts a serious American conflict in the 2020s (written in the
mid-1990s).
    * Brian McCullough: *How the Internet Happened: From Netscape to the
iPhone* - reminds us that the tech era is very new, only really about 10 years
old, and only began in earnest with iPhone adoption.
    * Kai-Fu Lee: *AI Superpowers* - how the recent history of the Chinese tech
buildout in the 2010s shows that they aren't just copycats.
* 142 Some reeading on *20th Century* history:
    * Curtis Yarvin: *Unqualified Reservations* - a broad survey of Western
historical anomalies, with a focus on the 20th and 19th centuries.
    * Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn: *The Gulag Archipelago* - what the Soviet
Union was actually like.
    * Yuri Slezkine: *The House of Government* - how the Soviet Union actually
worked.
    * Janet Malcom: *The Journalist and the Murderer* - how journalists
"befriend and betray" their subjects for clicks, a book taught in journalism
schools as something of a how-to manual.
    * Antony C. Sutton: *Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution* and *Wall
Street and the Rise of Hitler* - how different groups of capitalists funded
the communist and fascist revolutions respectively.
    * Ashley Rindsberg: *The Gray Lady Winked* - how the New York Times
systematically misrepresented the truth over the 20th century.
    * Nicholson Baker: *Human Smoke* - how World War 2 was far more brutal and
confusing than conventionally conveyed in textbooks.
    * Ion Grillo: *El Narco - Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency* - how
Mexico is far more beset by violence than commonly understood, and how this
relates to recent Americal influence.
    * Wolfgang Schivelbush: *Three New Deals* - how Roosevelt's New Deal was
directly inspired by fascist Italy and Germany.
    * Frank Dikotter: *The Cultural Revolution* - how Mao's cultural revolution
resembles the wokeness of modern America, with te BLM riots of 2022 proving
particularly similar.
    * Amity Shlaes: *The Forgotten Man* - how FDR's "bold, persistent
experimentation" helped turn a recession into a Great Depression.
    * Adem Fergusson: *When Money Dies* and Mel Gordon: *Volutous Panic* - the
monetary and cultural character of the Weimar Republic, and how it resembles
present day America.

### Fragmentation, Frontier, Fourth Turning, Future is Our Past
* 146 ...a movie like 2011's *Contagion* that depicts a competent CDC is now
just too far away from reality to permit suspension of disbelief. So insead we
get a movie like 2021's *Don't Look Up*, which depicts a chaotic America that's
still somehow the center of events, still the country which the world relies on,
but whose internal chaos causes it to fall short.
* 148 Fragmentation Thesis
    * *The Sovereign Individual*, written in 1999, is an incredible book that
nailed many aspects of our digital future decades in advance, Bitcoin prime
among them.
    * ...in short the thesis is that after many generations in which technology
favored centralization (railroads, telegraph, radio, television, movies, mass
production) since about 1950 it is now favoring decentralization (transistor,
personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency).
    * At the time, the mid-century US was more corporatist than
entrepreneurial. Yes, the system was capitalism. It was all about joining the
big company and working your way up, not founding one, except for the rare and
just beginning startup phenomenon on the West Coast, which was a million-fold
less common than it is now.
* 149 The Frontier Thesis
    * In the late 1900s, Fredrick Jackson Turner gave an influential talk on
the concept of the frontier as the crucial driving force in American history.
At that time, it was understood that the free land of the frontier was crucial
to the US in several ways - as a way for the abmitious to seek their fortunes,
as a national aspiration in the form of Manifest Destiny, as a bare land for
social experiments.
    * Today of course, the concept of the frontier and Manifest Destiny is not
only not admired, but has been pathologized since the 60s by the same
deconstructionism that is one half of wokeness. You know the story: the
American frontiersmen, like Columbus before them, were racists, colonialists,
and imperalists.
    * It's old-fashinoned, but it's probably healthier to think of the Native
Americans more like the 300 Spartans than as helpless victims - brave warriors
who fought valiantly but lost to superior forces.
    * Humanity managed to survive through a bloody 20th century. After 1991,
the frontier *reopened* as commerce on the internet was legalized. By the late
2010s, the combination of centralization and wokification (in the West) and
Xi-ification (in China) threatened to close this frontier too, but BTC and
web3 and the open metaverse have given the digital frontier a new lease on
life.
* 154 The Fourth Turning Thesis
    * *The Fourth Turning* and *Ages of Discord* both predict very significant
unrest within the US in the coming years. Ray Dalio does aas well in
*Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*, though he confines
most of his comments to monetary apocalypse. Their models are somewhat related.
    * *The Fourth Turning* came out in 1997 and is based on a quasi-cyclical
theory of Anglo-American history, where conflict erupts roughly every 75 years.
    * If you believe in these patterns and want a possible underlying driver of
them, 75 years is about one long human lifespan. So perhaps those who do not
remember history really *are* doomed to repeat it.
* 155 The Future is Our Past Thesis
    * Today, the internet frontier reopens; back then, the western frontier
closed.
    * Today, we experience COVID-19; back then we experienced the Spanish Flu.
    * Today, we have tech billionaires; back then we had the captains of
industry.
    * Today, founders like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey seem to be winning against
establishment jouralists; back then, the likes of Ida Tarbell demagogued and
defeated Rockefeller.
    * Today, we have cryptocurrencies; back then we witnessed the era of
private banking
    * Today, we have the inflation and cultural conflict of Weimar America;
back then, we had the inflation and cultural conflict of Weimar Germany.
    * Today, we have Airbnb; back then, we had flophouses.
    * Today, we have Uber; back then, we had gypsy cabs.
    * Today, The New York Times sides with Ukraine to fight nationalists
Russia; back the, The New York Times sided with communist Russia to starve out
Ukraine.
    * Today, we're seeing so-far unsuccessful calls for wealth seizures in the
US; back then, we saw Executive Order 6102, the successful seizure of gold.
    * Today, we're seeing the rise of the pseudonymous founder and startup
societies; back then, in the 1770s, we saw pseudonymous founders of startup
countries.
    * Today, we're seeing the re-encryption of the map; futher back in time,
before 1492, maps had *terra incognita*.
* 159 This model would explain why we're seeing an inversion: there was an
upward arc that favored the centralized State, but now we're in the middle
of a downward arc that favors the decentralized Network. So various historical
events are recurring with the opposite results, like the fluid flowing in the
reverse. And that's the thesis on how our Future is Our Past.

### Left is the New Right is the New Left
* 161 Marx's concept of a class struggle has been so influential that people
don't realize that sometimes those revolutionary classes *won*, and became
ruling classes. And then in turn fought the subsequent revolutionary classes.
* 161 Understanding this is important if you want to build a startup society.
Unless you are significantly differentiated from the establishment -- unless
you have a "10X value proposition", as a venture capitalist would put it --
you're not going to attract citizens.
* 164 ...consent can bound the scope of moral innovation. The communist
* revolutions of the 20th century were evil not just because of their murderous
results, but because they ran a giant human experiment on people against their
will. Those who wanted to opt out, to exit, were stopped by Berlin Walls a Iron
Curtains.
* 175 First the Republicans was concerned about the virus, and the Democrats
were calling people racists for paying attention to it. Then once Trump
starting saying the virus wasn't serious, positions flipped, with the Democrats
calling for (and implementing) lockdowns and the Republicans fighting them on
libertarian grounds. Then Trump flipped again to supporting vaccines, while
Biden, Harris, and other Democrats said they wouldn't trust a rushed Trump
vaccine. Then the vaccine came out (the same one developed under the Trump
Administration's Operation Warp Speed!) and many Democrats were suddenly all in
favor of mandating that which they once wanted to avoid, while many Republicans
now booed this as an intolerable infringement on liberty.
* 175 You can rationalize these twists and turns. Those who do so commonly
invoke Keynes: "When the facts change, I change my mind -- what do you do,
sir?"
* 183 The Unified Cycle
    * The left cycle starts with a group of revolutionary leftists that then
become institutional rightists.
    * The right cycle starts with a group of determined rightists that then
become decadent leftists.
    * The libertarian cycle starts wth a group of ideological libertarians that
end up building a bureaucratic state.
* 183 ...within our lives, we've seen many examples of a startup disrupting an
incumbent through scrappy tactics, becoming the incumbent themselves, and then
employing incumbent tactics to defend itself against a new wave of startups
coming up against it.
* 190 ...in practice, communism was slavery, because the workers had to
surrender 100% of their earnings to te state. As such, the Stakhanov posters
were more cynical than any capitalist breakroom infographic.
* 190 ...be as it may, communism had *traction*. At its peak it covered "26% of
the land surface of the globe." It was a secular ideology that commanded the
zeal of a religious movement -- pure State-worship, in our terminology, the
total replacement of G-o-d with G-o-v.
* 193 ...after 1991, there was no more *centralized* left, no more communism,
aside from holdouts like Cuba and North Korea that were of no global
consequence. Instead it became all about the *decentralized* left, the fusion
of the civil rights movement and Foucaltian deconstructionism, what we now
call wokeness.
* 193 If you;ll note, the wokes don't have a single leader like Stalin. They
have no single book like *The Communist Manifesto*. They don't even like to be
named. This is notable for a movement that is otherwise so interested in verba
prestidigation, in renaming things!
* 194 Wokes are primarily people of the Network, as their habitat is outside
the elected State. The control circuity for the US government resides outside
it, in media, academia, nonprofits, and the unfireable civil service.
* 198 Democrats have:
    * 97% of journalists' political donations
    * 98% of Twitter employees' political donations
    * >91% of professors in the top US universities
    * 26 out of 27 of the richest congressional districts
    * >77% of political donations from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft,
Google
