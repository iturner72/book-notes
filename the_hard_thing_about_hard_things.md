### Introduction
* ix "This the real world, homie, school finished They done stole your dreams,
  you dunno who did it." -Kanye West, "Gorgeous"

* ix every time i read a management or self-help book, i find myself saying,
  "that's fine, but that wasn't really the hard thing about the situation." the
  hard thing isn't setting a big, hairy, audacoius goal. the hard thing is
  laying people off when you miss the big goal. the hard thing isn't hiring
  great people. the hard thing is when those "great people" develop a snese of
  entitlement and start demanding unreasonable things. the hard thing isn't
  setting up an org chart. the hard thing is getting people to communitcate
  within the org that you just designed. the hard thing isn't dreaming big. the
  hard thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat when the
  dream turns into a nightmare.
