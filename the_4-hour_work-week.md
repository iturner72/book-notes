## The 4-Hour Workweek

by Tim Ferriss

*I, Ian Turner own this book and took these notes for my own learning, purchase
the book here: https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357*

## Step 1: D is for Definition

### 1 Cautions and Comparisons
* 20 He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn't
like to buy things he didn't need. Life had become a succession of trophy
wives--he was on lucky number three--expensive cars, and other empty bragging
rights. Mark was one of the living dead.
* 22 Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you
control in your life: *what* you do, *when* you do it, *where* you do it, and
with *whom* you do it. I call this the "freedom multiplier."

### 2 Rules That Change the Rules
* 31 Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing
more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario: in this case,
becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to
survive.
* 33 "Someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.
* 33 Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission: Get good at being a troublemaker and
saying sorry when you really screw up.

### 3 Dodging Bullets
* 41 Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would
be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight of my "don't happy,
be worry" phase: Why don't I decide exactly what my nightmare would bee--the
worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?
* 43 In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a
probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline
workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to.
* 46 Now that you've defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or
definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.)
or external?
* 47 As I have heard said, a person's success in life can usually be measured
by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.
* 47 It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you
don't pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five
years, and ten years?

### 4 System Reset
* 49 The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to
use some of the tactics I teach. It was simplicity itself: Contact three
seemingly impossible-to-reach people--J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J.D. Salinger, I
don't care--and get at least one to reply to three questions.
* 50 If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not
overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than
you think.
* 50 Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the
endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with
any goal.
* 53 Whenever one of us began to set our sights lower, lose faith, or "accept
reality," the other would chime in via phone or e-mail like an AA sponsor:
"Dude, are you turning into the bald fat man in the red BMW convertible?"
* 56 "I deal with rejection by persisting, not by taking my business elsewhere.
My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine: 'Ever triad. Ever
failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'"
* 64 Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days): For the next two days, practice gazing into
the eyes of others--whether people you pass on the street or conversational
partners--until they break contact.

## Step 2: E is for Elimination

### 5 The End of Time Management
* 68 First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase
negotiating leverage for two simultaneous objectives; pay raises and a remote
working arrangement.
* 70 *What* you do is infinitely more important than *how* you do it.
Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right
things.
* 70 "Pareto's Law" or the "Pareto Distribution," in the last decade also
popularly called the "80/20 Principle." The mathematical formula he used to
demostrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society--
80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the
population--also applied outside of economics.
* 71 Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my poblems and unhappiness? Which
20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?
* 77 Parkinson' Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance
and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the
magic of the imminent deadline.
* 77 Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). Shorten work
time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's Law).

### 6 The Low-Information Diet
* 87 But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn't happen. My contacts now
know that I don't respond to emergences, so the emergencies somehow don't exist
or don't come to me. Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you
remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others
* 88 From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of
one-third of one industry magazine (*Response* Magazine) and one business
magazine (*Inc.*) per month, for a grand total of aproximately four hours.
That's it for results-oriented reading. Iread an hour of fiction prior to bed
for relaxation.
* 93 Being sure to maintain eye contact, ask for the phone numbers of at least
two (the more you attempt, the less stressful it will be) attractive members of
the opposite sex on each day.

### 7 Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal
* 95  Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a
reputation for being assertive will help you recieve preferential treatment
without having to beg or fight for it every time.
* 97 Check e-mail twice per day, once at 10:00 noon or just prior to lunch,
and again at 4:00 PM. 12:00 PM. and 4:00 PM. are times that ensure you will
have the most responses from previously sent e-mail. Never check e-mail first
thing in the morning.
* 100 Don't encourage people to chitchat and don't let them chitchat. Get them
to the point immediately. If they meander or try to postpone for a later
undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point.
* 110 Hi All, I would like to establish a new policy for my account that
overrides all others. Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes
less than $100 to fix, use your judgment and fix it yourself. This is official
written permission and a request to fix all problems that cost under $100
without contacting me.

## Step 3: A is for Automation

### 8 Outsourcing Life
* 123 When I open Honey's file, I have this reaction: America is fucked. There
are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized breakdown of
her pets, measurements, and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all
Bangalorians are like Honey, I pity Americans about to graduate college.
They're up against a hungry, polite, Excel-proficient Indian army.
* 126 The outsourcing of my neuroses was one of the most successful experiments
of the month. Every  time I started to ruminate, I'd remind myself that Honey
was already on the case, and I'd relax. No joke--this alone was worth it.
* 128 But what about the cost? This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I
can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at all? *Because the
goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.*
* 130 Eliminate before you delegate. Never automate something that can be
eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined.
* 136 Foreign assistance isn't just for the small time. I know from firsthand
discussions that executives from big five accounting and management consulting
firms routinely charge clients six figures for research reports that are then
farmed to India for low four figures.
* 138 Besides simple disaster avoidance, a group atructure provides a pool of
talent that allows you to assign multiple tasks without bothering to find a
new person with the qualifications. Brickwork and YMII both exemplify this
type of structure and provide a single point of contact, a personal account
manager, who then farms out your tasks to the most-capable people in the group
and across different shifts.
* 142 Note that I asked him to respond *if* he didn't understand or had
questions. This is the wrong approach. Ask foreign VSa to rephrase tasks to
confirm understanding before getting started.

### 9 Income Autopilot 1
* 153 This chapter is not for people who want to *run* businesses but for those
who want to *own* businesses and spend no time on them.
* 156 NO2 was priced at an outrageous $79.95, positioned as the premium product
on the market, and sold exclusively through GNC stores nationwide. No one else
was permitted to sell it. How can it make sense to turn away business? There
are a few good reasons. First, the more competing resellers there are, the
faster your product goes extinct.
* 161 It Should Cost the Customer $50-200. The bulk of companies set prices in
the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low is
shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit
margin and drive you both bankrupt.
* 162 It Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture. This is
critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without
stockpiling product in advance.
* 174 Tools and Tricks page where different websites can help for things like:
Confirming Sufficient Market Size, Finding Products to Resell or Manufacture,
Finding Public Domain Information to Repurpose, Recording Seminars of Phone
Interviews with Experts for CD Downloadable Products, Licensing Ideas to Others
for Royalties, Searching for Patents for Unexploited Ideas to Turn into
Products, and Becoming and Expert.

### 10 Income Autopilot 2
* 179 The moral is that intuition and experience are poor predictors of which
products and businesses will be profitable. Focus groups are equally
misleading. Ask ten people if they would but your product. Then tell those who
said "yes" that you have ten units in your car and ask them to buy. The initial
positive responses, given by people who want to be liked and aim to please,
become polite refusals as soon as real money is at stake.
* 183 How did I come up with the most successful BodyQUICK headline ("The
Fastest Way to Increase Power and Speed Guaranteed")? I borrowed it from the
longest-running, and thus most profitable, Rosetta Stone headline: "The Fastest
Way to Learn a Language Guaranteed."
* 187 The results of her small test are no garantee of future success, but the
indications are positive enough that she decides to set up a Yahoo Store for
$99 per month and a small per-transaction fee. Her credit isn't excellent, so
she will opt to use www.paypal.com to accept credit cards online instead of
approaching her bank for a merchant account.

### 11 Income Autopilot 3
* 200 The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog.
The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man
from touvhing the equipment.
* 201 The contradictory advice you find in business books and elsewhere usually
relates to managing employees--how to handle the human element. Herb tells you
to give them a hug, Revson tells you to kick them in the balls, and I tell you
to solve the problem by eliminating it altogether: Remove the human element.
* 210 Serving the customer ("customer service") is not becoming a persoal
concierge and catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is
providing an excellent product at an acceptable price and solving legitimate
problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner
possible.
* 214 The lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when
someone can abuse it for profit like in the BodyQUICK example, but it isn't ...
*if* your product delivers. Most people are honest.
* 216 Once per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a crowded
public place at some point. Lunchtime is ideal. It wacn be a well-trafficked
sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular bar. There is no real
technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for about ten
seconds, and then get up and continue on with whatever you were doing before. I
used to do this at nightclubs to clear space for beak-dancing circles.
* 217 It isn't enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used
to acting outside the box.

Infomercial Producers, Retail and International Product Distribution, Celebrity
Brokers, Celebrity Finding


## Step 4: L is for Liberation

### 12 Disappearing Act
* 227 By working faithfully eight hours a day, you may eventually get to be a
boss and work twelve hours a day.
* 229 In Japan, a three-piece zombie who joins the 9-5 grind each morning is
called a *sarai-man*--salaryman--and, in the last few years, a new verb has
emerged: *datsu-sara suru*, to escape(datsu) the salaryman(sara) lifestyle.
* 232 The quantifiable end result was three more designs per day than his usual
average and three total hours of additional billable client time. For
explanations, he identifies removal of commute and fewer disctractions from
office noise.
* 233 Sherwood didn't expect to get two days per week approved. He asked for
two so that, in the case his boss refused, he could ask for just one as a
fallback position (bracketing).
* 234 Employee: What's your main concern? Boss: It seems like you're on your
way out. I mean, are you going to quit on us? Second, what if everyone wants to
do the same? Employee: Fair enough. Good points. First, to be honest, I was
close to quitting befoe, with all the interruptions and commute and whatnot,
but I'm actually feeling great now with the change in routine.
* 235 Sherwood's team is in the middle of a project that requires his
expertise, and he is prepared to quit if his boss refuses. He realizes that,
just as you want to negotiate ad pricing close to deadlines, getting what you
want often depends more on *when* you ask for it than *how* you ask for it.
* 239 Don't underestimate how much you company needs you. Perform well and ask
for what you want. If you don't get it over time, leave. It's too big a world
to spend most of life in a cubicle.


### 13 Beyond Repair
* 243 Most people aren't lucky enough to get fired and die a slow spiritual
death over 30-40 years of tolerating the mediocre.
* 245 If you've made it this far in life, losing or dropping a job will often
be little more than a few weeks of vacation (unless you want more) prior to
something better.
* 250 Tools and Tricks: Considering Options and Pulling the Trigger, Opening
Retirement Accounts, Health Insurance for Self-employed or Unemployed

### 14 Mini-Retirements
* 252 Fables and Fortune Hunters story: "That's the best part. When the time
is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public
and become very rich. You would make millions." "Million's, senor? Then what?"
"Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you
would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your
wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine ad
play your guitar with your amigos..." This is of course the current life of the
fisherman.
* 255 If you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency, even
after creating the mobility to take extanded trips, will be to go nuts and see
10 countries in 14 dats and end up a wreck. It's like taking a starving dog to
an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death.
* 265 Prior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed about how to fit all of my
belongings into a 14 x 10-foot rental storage space. Then I realized a few
things: I would never reread the business magazines I'd saved, I wore the same
five shirts and four pairs of pnts 90% of the time, it was about time for new
furniture, and I never used the outdoor grill or lawn furnitue.
* 270 I recommend choosing an overseas locations that will seem foreign but
isn't dangerous. I box. race motorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but
I draw the line at *favelas*, civilians with machine guns, pedestrians with
machetes, and social strife.
