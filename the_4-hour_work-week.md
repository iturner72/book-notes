## The 4-Hour Work-week

by Tim Ferriss

*I, Ian Turner own this book and took these notes for my own learning, purchase

## Step 1: D is for Definition

### 1 Cautions and Comparisons
* 20 He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn't
like to buy things he didn't need. Life had become a succession of trophy
wives--he was on lucky number three--expensive cars, and other empty bragging
rights. Mark was one of the living dead.
* 22 Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you
control in your life: *what* you do, *when* you do it, *where* you do it, and
with *whom* you do it. I call this the "freedom multiplier."

### 2 Rules That Change the Rules
* 31 Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing
more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario: in this case,
becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to
survive.
* 33 "Someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.
* 33 Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission: Get good at being a troublemaker and
saying sorry when you really screw up.

### 3 Dodging Bullets
* 41 Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would
be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight of my "don't happy,
be worry" phase: Why don't I decide exactly what my nightmare would bee--the
worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?
* 43 In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a
probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline
workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to.
* 46 Now that you've defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or
definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.)
or external?
* 47 As I have heard said, a person's success in life can usually be measured
by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.
* 47 It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you
don't pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five
years, and ten years?

### 4 System Reset
* 49 The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to
use some of the tactics I teach. It was simplicity itself: Contact three
seemingly impossible-to-reach people--J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J.D. Salinger, I
don't care--and get at least one to reply to three questions.
* 50 If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not
overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than
you think.
* 50 Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the
endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with
any goal.
* 53 Whenever one of us began to set our sights lower, lose faith, or "accept
reality," the other would chime in via phone or e-mail like an AA sponsor:
"Dude, are you turning into the bald fat man in the red BMW convertible?"
* 56 "I deal with rejection by persisting, not by taking my business elsewhere.
My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine: 'Ever triad. Ever
failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'"
* 64 Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days): For the next two days, practice gazing into
the eyes of others--whether people you pass on the street or conversational
partners--until they break contact.

## Step 2: E is for Elimination

### 5 The End of Time Management
* 68 First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase
negotiating leverage for two simultaneous objectives; pay raises and a remote
working arrangement.
* 70 *What* you do is infinitely more important than *how* you do it.
Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right
things.
* 70 "Pareto's Law" or the "Pareto Distribution," in the last decade also
popularly called the "80/20 Principle." The mathematical formula he used to
demostrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society--
80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the
population--also applied outside of economics.
* 71 Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my poblems and unhappiness? Which
20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?
* 77 Parkinson' Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance
and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the
magic of the imminent deadline.
* 77 Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). Shorten work
time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's Law).

### 6 The Low-Information Diet
* 87 But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn't happen. My contacts now
know that I don't respond to emergences, so the emergencies somehow don't exist
or don't come to me. Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you
remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others
* 88 From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of
one-third of one industry magazine (*Response* Magazine) and one business
magazine (*Inc.*) per month, for a grand total of aproximately four hours.
That's it for results-oriented reading. Iread an hour of fiction prior to bed
for relaxation.
* 93 Being sure to maintain eye contact, ask for the phone numbers of at least
two (the more you attempt, the less stressful it will be) attractive members of
the opposite sex on each day.
