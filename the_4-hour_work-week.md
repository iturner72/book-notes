## Step 1: D is for Definition

### 1 Cautions and Comparisons
* 20 He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn't
like to buy things he didn't need. Life had become a succession of trophy
wives--he was on lucky number three--expensive cars, and other empty bragging
rights. Mark was one of the living dead.
* 22 Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you
control in your life: *what* you do, *when* you do it, *where* you do it, and
with *whom* you do it. I call this the "freedom multiplier."

### 2 Rules That Change the Rules
* 31 Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing
more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario: in this case,
becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to
survive.
* 33 "Someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.
* 33 Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission: Get good at being a troublemaker and
saying sorry when you really screw up.

### 3 Dodging Bullets
* 41 Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would
be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight of my "don't happy,
be worry" phase: Why don't I decide exactly what my nightmare would bee--the
worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?
* 43 In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a
probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline
workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to.
* 46 Now that you've defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or
definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.)
or external?
* 47 As I have heard said, a person's success in life can usually be measured
by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.
* 47 It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you
don't pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five
years, and ten years?
