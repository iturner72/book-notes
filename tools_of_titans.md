### Foreword (By Arnold Schwarzenegger)
* ix But it is not true that I am self-made. Like everyone, to get to where I
    am, I stood on the shoulders of giants.
* x I've always treated the world as my classroom, soaking up lessons and
    stories to fuel my path forward. I hope you do the same. The worst thing you
    can ever do is think that you know enough. Never stop learning. Ever.

## Part 1 Healthy

### Amelia Boone
* 4 Rolling your foot on top of a golf ball on the floor to increase "hamstring"
    flexibility. This is infinitely more helpful than a lacrosse ball. Put a
    towel on the floor underneath the golf ball, lest you shoot your dog's eye
    out.
* 5 Amelia eats Pop-Tarts as part of her ritual pre-competition breakfast.
* 5 Amelia loves doing training runs in the rain and cold, as she knows her
    competition is probably opting out. This is an example of "rehearsing the
    worst-case scenario" to become more resilient.

### Rhonda Perciavalle Patrick
* 7 If you are having your wisdom teeth removed, or if your kids are losing
    their baby teeth (which have a particularly high concentration of dental
    pulp stem calls), cconsider using a company like StemSave or National Dental
    Pulp Laboratory to preserve them for later use.
* 8 Hot baths can also significantly increase GH over baseline, and both sauna
    and hot baths have been shown to cause a massive release in prolactin, which
    plays a role in wound healing.

### Christopher Sommer
* 12 Male Olympic gymnasts don't have biceps the size of their waists from
    curls. It comes largely from straight-arm work, especially Maltese work on
    rings.

### Dominic D'agostino
* 24 Dom suggests a 5-day fast 2 to 3 times per year.
* 27 High protein and low fat doesn't work. Your liver will convert excess amino
    acids into glucose and shut down ketogenesis. Fat as 20 to 85% of calories
    is required.
* 28 Example breakfast: 4 eggs (cooked in butter and coconut oil), 1 can of
    sardines packed in olive oil, .5 can oysters, some asparagus.
* 29 Example dinner: Mixed greens and spinach, extra-virgin olive oil,
    artichokes, avacado, MCT oil, parmesan or feta cheese, some chicken or fish.
* 29 Dom views vegetables as "fat delivery systems."
* 31 "Fasting before chemotherapy is definitely something that should be
    implemented in our oncology wards," says Dom. He adds, "Fasting essentially
    slows (sometimes stope) Rapidly dividing cells and triggers an 'energetic
    crisis' that makes cancer cells selectively velnerable to chemo and
    ratiation." THere are good studies to support this.

### Patrick Arnold
* 37 Both Patrick Arnold and his frequesnt collaborator, Dominic D'Agostino,
    PhD, are interested in metformin, which is not their creation. Dom considers
    it the most promising of the anti-aging drugs from a scientific standpoint,
    and I would estimate that a dozen of the poeple in this book use it.

### Joe De Sena
* 38 Joe De Sena (@spartanrace) is the cofounder of the Death Race, Spartan Race
    (more than 1 million competitors), and more.
* 39 I had to get back to this place where you just want water, food, and
shelter. All the craziness of my life--this Wall Street life I had taken
on--would melt away."
* 39 "Hurricane Irene washed out a bridge on his property. A 1-ton metal I-beam
    had been stuck in the water for a few years, and the state was going to fine
    him some obscene amount if he didn't remove it. It would have cost him tens
    of thousands of dollars to have it removed, so instead, he had his winter
    Death Racers get in the river in January and remove it for him. It took us
    probably 8 hours. I came away with second-degree frostbit in most of my
    toes, as did many others. And the hilarious part? People paid HIM to
    experience that (the race entrance fee) AND he avoided fines and the cost of
    removal. Fucking genius."

### Wim "The Iceman" Hof
* 41 Wim Hof (@iceman_hof) is a Dutch world record holder nicknamed "The
    Iceman." He is the creator of the Wim Hof Method and holds more than 20
    world records.
* 42 *A Mind-Blowing Experiment*
    * 1. Do a set of push-ups and end a few repetitions short of failure. Record
         the number.
    * 2. Rest at least 30 minutes.
    * 3. Do ~40 repetitions of the following breathing exercise: Max inhale
         (raise chest) and "let go" exhale (drop chest sharply). The let-go
         exhale can be thought of as a short "hah." If yho're doing this
         correctly, after 20 to 30 reps you might feel loose, mild
         lightheadedness, and a little abit of tingling. The ingling is often
         felt in the hands first.
    * 4. On the last breathing cycle, breathe in completely, exhale completely,
         then do another set of push-ups. More often than not, prople will
         experience a sharp increase in the max number of push-ups, even though
         their lungs are empty.

### Jason Nemer
* 46 Jason Nemer (@jasonnemer) is a cofounder of AcroYoga, which blends the
    spiritual wisdom of yoga, the loving-kindness of Thai massage, and the
    dynamic power of acrobatics.
* 47 In 2015, I sat next to Jason at a dinner party at a friend's house in L.A.
    Somehow, my lower-back pain--which had been plaguing me--came up, and he
    offered to "fly" me on the spot. Having nmo idea what that was , I agreed
    and ended up getting spun around in the air on his feet for about 15
    minutes.
* 50 *Billboard* Play! Play more. I feel like perople are so serious, and it
    doesn't take much for people to drop back into the wisdom of a childlike
    playfulness.

### Deconstructing Sports and Skills with Questions
* When I was interviewing athletes and coaches from 2008 to 2010, digging up
    non-obvious tactics for *The 4-Hour Body*, I sent different combinations of
    the following questions to dozens of experts. These can be modified for any
    skill or topic, not just sports. Just replace [SPORT] with what you want to
    learn, and track down your mentors. You can often find past gold and silver
    medalists willing to answer these via Skype for $50 to $100 per hour, which
    is an incredible steal and could save your uears of wasted effort.

### Peter Attia
* 59 Peter Attia, MD (@peterattiamd) is a former ultra-endurance athlete,
    compulsive self-experimenter, and one of the most fascinating human beings I
    know. he is one of my go-to doctors for anything performance or
    longevity-related. Peter earned his MD from Stanford University and holds a
    BSc in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics from Queen's
    Univesrsity in Kingston, Ontario. He did his residency in general surgery at
    the Johns Hopkins Hostpital, and conducted research at the National Cancer
    Institute under Dr. Steven Rosenberg, where Peter focused on the role of
    regulatory T cells in cancer regression and other impune-based therapies for
    cancer.
* 60 *Peter's Breakfasst*: "It usually starts with nothing, and then I usually
    do a second course -- because I'm a little hungry -- and I'll have a little
    more nothing. I usually top it off with a bit of nothing.
