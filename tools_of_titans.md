### Foreword (By Arnold Schwarzenegger)
* ix But it is not true that I am self-made. Like everyone, to get to where I
    am, I stood on the shoulders of giants.
* x I've always treated the world as my classroom, soaking up lessons and
    stories to fuel my path forward. I hope you do the same. The worst thing you
    can ever do is think that you know enough. Never stop learning. Ever.
