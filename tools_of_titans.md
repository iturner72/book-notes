### Foreword (By Arnold Schwarzenegger)
* ix But it is not true that I am self-made. Like everyone, to get to where I
    am, I stood on the shoulders of giants.
* x I've always treated the world as my classroom, soaking up lessons and
    stories to fuel my path forward. I hope you do the same. The worst thing you
    can ever do is think that you know enough. Never stop learning. Ever.

## Part 1 Healthy

### Amelia Boone
* 4 Rolling your foot on top of a golf ball on the floor to increase "hamstring"
    flexibility. This is infinitely more helpful than a lacrosse ball. Put a
    towel on the floor underneath the golf ball, lest you shoot your dog's eye
    out.
* 5 Amelia eats Pop-Tarts as part of her ritual pre-competition breakfast.
* 5 Amelia loves doing training runs in the rain and cold, as she knows her
    competition is probably opting out. This is an example of "rehearsing the
    worst-case scenario" to become more resilient.

### Rhonda Perciavalle Patrick
* 7 If you are having your wisdom teeth removed, or if your kids are losing
    their baby teeth (which have a particularly high concentration of dental
    pulp stem calls), cconsider using a company like StemSave or National Dental
    Pulp Laboratory to preserve them for later use.
* 8 Hot baths can also significantly increase GH over baseline, and both sauna
    and hot baths have been shown to cause a massive release in prolactin, which
    plays a role in wound healing.

### Christopher Sommer
* 12 Male Olympic gymnasts don't have biceps the size of their waists from
    curls. It comes largely from straight-arm work, especially Maltese work on
    rings.

### Dominic D'agostino
* 24 Dom suggests a 5-day fast 2 to 3 times per year.
* 27 High protein and low fat doesn't work. Your liver will convert excess amino
    acids into glucose and shut down ketogenesis. Fat as 20 to 85% of calories
    is required.
* 28 Example breakfast: 4 eggs (cooked in butter and coconut oil), 1 can of
    sardines packed in olive oil, .5 can oysters, some asparagus.
* 29 Example dinner: Mixed greens and spinach, extra-virgin olive oil,
    artichokes, avacado, MCT oil, parmesan or feta cheese, some chicken or fish.
* 29 Dom views vegetables as "fat delivery systems."
* 31 "Fasting before chemotherapy is definitely something that should be
    implemented in our oncology wards," says Dom. He adds, "Fasting essentially
    slows (sometimes stope) Rapidly dividing cells and triggers an 'energetic
    crisis' that makes cancer cells selectively velnerable to chemo and
    ratiation." THere are good studies to support this.

### Patrick Arnold
* 37 Both Patrick Arnold and his frequesnt collaborator, Dominic D'Agostino,
    PhD, are interested in metformin, which is not their creation. Dom considers
    it the most promising of the anti-aging drugs from a scientific standpoint,
    and I would estimate that a dozen of the poeple in this book use it.

### Joe De Sena
* 38 Joe De Sena (@spartanrace) is the cofounder of the Death Race, Spartan Race
    (more than 1 million competitors), and more.
* 39 I had to get back to this place where you just want water, food, and
shelter. All the craziness of my life--this Wall Street life I had taken
on--would melt away."
* 39 "Hurricane Irene washed out a bridge on his property. A 1-ton metal I-beam
    had been stuck in the water for a few years, and the state was going to fine
    him some obscene amount if he didn't remove it. It would have cost him tens
    of thousands of dollars to have it removed, so instead, he had his winter
    Death Racers get in the river in January and remove it for him. It took us
    probably 8 hours. I came away with second-degree frostbit in most of my
    toes, as did many others. And the hilarious part? People paid HIM to
    experience that (the race entrance fee) AND he avoided fines and the cost of
    removal. Fucking genius."

### Wim "The Iceman" Hof
* 41 Wim Hof (@iceman_hof) is a Dutch world record holder nicknamed "The
    Iceman." He is the creator of the Wim Hof Method and holds more than 20
    world records.
* 42 *A Mind-Blowing Experiment*
    * 1. Do a set of push-ups and end a few repetitions short of failure. Record
         the number.
    * 2. Rest at least 30 minutes.
    * 3. Do ~40 repetitions of the following breathing exercise: Max inhale
         (raise chest) and "let go" exhale (drop chest sharply). The let-go
         exhale can be thought of as a short "hah." If yho're doing this
         correctly, after 20 to 30 reps you might feel loose, mild
         lightheadedness, and a little abit of tingling. The ingling is often
         felt in the hands first.
    * 4. On the last breathing cycle, breathe in completely, exhale completely,
         then do another set of push-ups. More often than not, prople will
         experience a sharp increase in the max number of push-ups, even though
         their lungs are empty.

### Jason Nemer
* 46 Jason Nemer (@jasonnemer) is a cofounder of AcroYoga, which blends the
    spiritual wisdom of yoga, the loving-kindness of Thai massage, and the
    dynamic power of acrobatics.
* 47 In 2015, I sat next to Jason at a dinner party at a friend's house in L.A.
    Somehow, my lower-back pain--which had been plaguing me--came up, and he
    offered to "fly" me on the spot. Having nmo idea what that was , I agreed
    and ended up getting spun around in the air on his feet for about 15
    minutes.
* 50 *Billboard* Play! Play more. I feel like perople are so serious, and it
    doesn't take much for people to drop back into the wisdom of a childlike
    playfulness.

### Deconstructing Sports and Skills with Questions
* When I was interviewing athletes and coaches from 2008 to 2010, digging up
    non-obvious tactics for *The 4-Hour Body*, I sent different combinations of
    the following questions to dozens of experts. These can be modified for any
    skill or topic, not just sports. Just replace [SPORT] with what you want to
    learn, and track down your mentors. You can often find past gold and silver
    medalists willing to answer these via Skype for $50 to $100 per hour, which
    is an incredible steal and could save your uears of wasted effort.

### Peter Attia
* 59 Peter Attia, MD (@peterattiamd) is a former ultra-endurance athlete,
    compulsive self-experimenter, and one of the most fascinating human beings I
    know. he is one of my go-to doctors for anything performance or
    longevity-related. Peter earned his MD from Stanford University and holds a
    BSc in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics from Queen's
    Univesrsity in Kingston, Ontario. He did his residency in general surgery at
    the Johns Hopkins Hostpital, and conducted research at the National Cancer
    Institute under Dr. Steven Rosenberg, where Peter focused on the role of
    regulatory T cells in cancer regression and other impune-based therapies for
    cancer.
* 60 *Peter's Breakfasst*: "It usually starts with nothing, and then I usually
    do a second course -- because I'm a little hungry -- and I'll have a little
    more nothing. I usually top it off with a bit of nothing.
* 61 Peter wears a Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitor to track his glucose
    levels 24/7, which are displayed on his iPhone. His real goal, if he could
    wave a magic wand, is to keep his average glucose and glucose variability
    low. Outside of a lab, this approximates minimizing your insulin "area under
    the curve" (AUC). To accomplish this, Peter aims to keep his average glucose
    (per 24-hour period) at 84 to 88 mg/dl and his standard deviation below 15.
* 61 Peter once visited me in San Francisco and we went to the gym together. In
    between sets of deadlifts and various chalk-laden macho moves, I glanced
    over and saw Peter in a centerfold pose doing what looked like a Jane Fonda
    workout. Once I finished laughing, he explained that he avoided knee surgery
    thanks to this exercise set taught to him by speed guru Ryan Flaherty and
    kinesiologist Brian Dorfman. I tried his "reverse thighmaster" series and
    was dumbstruck by how weak my glute medius was. It was excruciating, and I
    felt and looked like an idiot.
* 67 "If you're over 40 and don't smoke, there's about a 70 to 80% chance you'll
    die from one of four diseases: heart desease, cerebrovascular disease,
    cancer, or neurodegenerative disease."
* 69 *More comedy - Long ago, when Peter went from 170 to 210 pounds, gaining
    mostly fat*: "Frankly, I just got aggravated beyon words. We joke about it
    noe, but at the time I literally said to my wife, 'I'm going to go get a
    gastric bypass.' And she said, 'You are the most rediculous human being
    who's ever lived. We're going to have to talk about our marriage, if that's
    what you're considering at the weight of 210 pounds.' I actually did go and
    see the top bariatrician in the city of San Diego, and it's kind of a weird
    story because, even though I was obviously overweight, I was the thinnest
    person in the waiting room by a long shot.

### Justin Mager
* 72 Dr Justin Mager has helped me with dozens of my "human guinea pig" experiments,
complete with blood testing and next-generation tracking. He's brilliant and
hilarious.
* 73 "I like to ask that to physicians, especially if they're antagonizing me about
    my practice methods. I say, 'Hey, what does cholesterol do?' and it's
    interesting, because a lot of them will take a step back and they'll fumble,
    because ther're so indoctrinated into the algorithm of 'All I really need to
    do is identify high cholesterol and treat it' versus understanding what
    purpose it serves in the human body."

### Charles Poliquin
* 74 Charles Poliquin (@strengthsensei) is one of the best-known strngth coaches
    in the world. He has trained elite atheletes from nearly 20 different
    sports, incuding Olympic gold medalists, NFL All-Pros, NHL All-Starts and
    Stanley Cup champions, and IFBB bodybuilding champions.
* 75 Charles takes breakfast seriously. His typical combo includes some type of
    wild meat (typically pan fried in Meyenberg goat butter), nuts, and
    sometimes berries or avocados.
* 78 "The fron squat. I have a lot of statistical data on that. Because it is
    impossible to cheat on the front squat. I'm talking ass-to-the-grass front
    squat, meaning you leave a stain in the carpet in the bottom position.

### The Slow Barb Diet
* Rule 1: Avoid "white" starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This
    means all bread, pasta, rice, potates, and grains (yes, including quinoa).
    If you have to ask, don't eat it.
* Rule 2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially fr breakfast
    and lunch. If you want to keep it simple, split your plate into thirds:
    protein, vegges, and beans/legumes.
* Rule 3: Don't drink calories. Exception: 1 to 2 glasses of dry red wine per
    night is allowed, although this can caus esome peri-/post-menopausal women
    to plateau.
* Rule 4: Don't eat fruit. (Fructose -> glycerol phosphate -> more body fat,
    more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are allowed.
* Rule 5: Whenever possible, measure your progress in body fat percentage, NOT
    total punds. The scale can deceive and derail you. For instance, it's common
    to gain muscle while simultaneously losing fat on the SCD. That's exactly
    what you want, but the scale number won't move ,and you will get frustrated.
    In place of the scale, I use DEXA scans, a BodyMetrix home ultrasound device,
    or calipers with a gym professional.
* Rule 6: Rake one day off per week and go nuts. Some readers keep a "to-eat"
    list during the week, which reminds them that they're only giving up vices
    for 6 days at a time.

### Pavel Tsatsouline
* 85 Pavel Tsatsouline is Chairman of Strong First, Inc., a worldwide school of
    strength. He is a former physical training instructor for Spetsnaz, the
    Soviet special forces, and is currently a subject matter expert to the U.S.
    Marine Corps, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Navy SEALs.
* 86 "If you are training for strength, you want to try and avoid the burn
    altogether. The burn is your enemy.

### Laird Hamilton, Gabby Reece & Brian MacKenzie
* 92 Laird Hamilton (@lairdlife) is widely considered the greatest big wave surfer
    of all time. He is credited with the creation of tow-in surfing (using a Jet
    Skie to pull surfers into enormous waves), as well as the rebirth of
    stand-upp paddle boarding.
* 92 Gabrielle Reece (@gabbyreece) has been named on of the "20 Most Influential
    Women in Sports" by *Women's Sports & Fitness* and is best known for her
    success in volleyball.
* 92 Brian MacKenzie(@iamunscared) is the founder of Cross-Fit Endurance and the
    author of the *New Yok Times* best-selling book *Unbreakable Runner*.
* 94 Gabby: "I always say that I'll go first... That means if I'm chacking out
    at the store, I'll say Hello first. If I'm coming across somebody and make
    eye contact, I'll smile first. [I wish] people would experiment with that in
    their life a little bit: Be first, because -- not all times, but most times
    -- it comes in your favor."
* 98 Laird: "All you flexible people should go bang some iron, and all you big
    weight lifters should go do some yoga... We always gravitate toward our
    strengths because we want to be in our glory."

### James Fadiman
* 100 James Fadiman, PhD (psychedelicresearch@gmail.com), has been involved with
    psychedelic research since the 1960s. He did his undergraduate work at
    Harvard and his graduate work at Stanford, where he collaborated with the
    Harvard Group, the West Coast Research Group in Menlo Park, and Ken Kesey.
* 102 Many psychedelics (psilocybin, mescaline, etc.) have been used
    ceremonially for hundereds or thousands of years by indigenous cultures.
    More recently, universities around the world have begun testing these
    molecules for addressing treatment-resistant depression, removing
    end-of-life anxiety in terminal cancer patients, ending nicotine addiction,
    and more.
* 104 For me, mderate to high dose of psilocybin with supervision serves as a
    hard reboot. It closes all the windows, "force quits" all the applications,
    flushes the cache, installs upgrades, and -- whe I'm back to "normal" --
    restores my 30,000-foot view. It removes the noise, giving me a crystal
    clear view of the most critical priorities and decisions.
* 105 Ethnobotanist Terence McKenna coinded the term "heroic dose," which is
    often equated to 5 or more gras of mushrooms or more than 400 mcg of LSD.
    James doesn't recommend this brute-force dosing, which McKenna described as
    "sufficient to flatten the most resistant ego."
* 106 In Jum's opinion, microdosing psychedelics does a far better job than a
    whole class of drugs we now call "cognitive enhancers," most of which are
    simply derivatives of speed.

### Martin Polanco and Dan Engle
* 109 Martin Polanco MD (@martin_polanco7), is the founder and program director
    of Crossroads Treatment Center, based in Rosarito, Mexico. Crossroads
    specializes in helping patients conquer powerful addictions (such as heroin
    or cocain) using the African hallucinogen ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT, also
    referred to as "the God molecule."
* 109 Dan Engle, MD (@drdanengle), is board certified in psychiatry and
    neurology. He combines functional medicine with integrative psychiatry to
    enhance regenerative health and peak performance.
* 118 There are certain images than can be disturbing to patients. You do see
    spirits and images of dead people. In Africa, thay say ibogaine is a
    'controlled-death experience.' So you go into the land of the dead, and
    you're given information by your ancestors, which you can then take back
    into this world and apply to your life."

### Kelly Starrett
* 122 Dr. Kelly Starrett (@mobilitywod) is one of my favorite performance
    coaches. He has trained CrossFit athletes for more than 150,000 hours and 11
    ears at San Francisco CrossFit which he founded with his wife in 2005.
* 126 Dark means DARK. "They've done studies where they shine a laser on the
    back of someone's knee, and people pick it up. It's light. You cannot have
    your phone in your room. You cannot have a TV in your room. It needs to be
    black, black as night."

### Paul Levesque (Triple H)
* 128 Paul Levesque (@tripleh) is a 14-time world champion in World Wrestling
    Entertainment (WWE). He is also the Executive Vice President of talent,
    live events, and creative at the WWE.
* 129 During his peak travel period, Paul traveled 260+ days per year,
    performing in a different city each night. Here is one of his rules: "When I
    landed, I would check into the hotel. The second we checked in, I'd ask
    them: 'Is the gym open? Can I go train?' Even if it was to get on a bike and
    ride for 15 minutes to reset things. I learned early that it seemed any time
    I did that, I didn't get jet lag."

### Jane McGonigal
* 132 Janve McGonigal, PhD (@avantgame), is a research affliliate at the
    Insitute for Future and the author of the *New York Times* bestseller
    *Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the
    World*.
* 133 I've interviewed two people who have identical twins: Jane McGonigal and
    Caroline Paul. Both have experienced real-time "spooky action at a
    distance": feeling or perceiving what their twin is experiencing.

### Adam Gazzaley
* 135 Dr. Adam Gazzaley (@adamgazz) earned his MD and PhD in Neuroscience at the
    Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, then did postdoctoral training
    in cognitive neuroscience at UC Berkely.
* 137 Advice to your 30-year-old self? " I would say to have no fear. I mean,
    you've got one chance here to do amazing things, and being afraid of being
    wrong or making a mistake or fumbling is just not how you do something of
    impact. You just have to be fearless.

## Part 2 Wealthy

### Chris Sacca
* 164 Chris Sacca (@sacca) is an early-stage investor in dozens of companies,
    including Twitter, Uber, Instagram, Kickstarter, and Twilio.
* 169 An excerpt from that speech: Weirdness is why we adore our friends...
    Weirdness is what bonds us to our colleagues. Weirdness is what sets us
    apart, gets us hired. Be your unapologetically weird self. In fact, being
    weird may even find you the ultimate happiness."

### Marc Andreessen
* 170 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) is a legendary figure in Silicon Valley, and his
    creations have changed the world. Even in the epicenter of tech, it's hard
    to find a more fascinating icon. Marc co-created the highly influential
    Mosaic browser, the first widely used graphical web broweser. He also
    co-founded Netscape, which later sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. He then
    co-founded Loudcloud, which sold as Opsware to Hewaltt-Packard for $1.6
    billion. He's considered one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet,
    alongside pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, who launched the Uniform Resouce
    Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and early HTML standards.
* 171 "Raise Prices" This was Marc's response to "If you could have a billboard
    anywhere, what would it say?" He'd put it right in the heart of San
    Francisco, and here's the reason: "The number-one therme that companies have
    when they really struggle is they are not charging enough for their product.
    It has become conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley that the way to succeed
    is to price your product as low as possiblem under the theory that if it's
    low-priced, everybody can but it, and that's how you get to volume," he
    said. "Is your product any good if people won't pay more for it?"
* 171 Don't Fetishize Failure: "I'm old-fashioned. Where I come from, people
    like to succeed...When I was a founder, when I first started out, we didn't
    have the word 'pivot.' We didn't have a fancy word for it. We just called it
    a fuck-up.
* 171 "We call our test 'What do the nerds do on nights and weekends?' Their day
    job is Oracle, Salesforce.com, Adoble, or Apple, or Intel or one of these
    companies, or an insurance company, bank [or they're a student]. Whatever.
    That's fine. They go do whatever they need to do to make a living. The
    question is: What's the hobby? What's the thing at night or onthe weekend?
    Then things get really interesting."

### Arnold Schwarzenegger
* 176 Arnold Schwarzenegger (@schwarzenegger) was born in Thal, Austria in 1947,
    and by the age of 20 dominated the soprt of competitive bodybuilding,
    becoming the youngest person ever to win the Mr. Universe title.
* 179 "By the time I came to America and started competing over here [I would
    say to my competitors something like], 'Let me ask you something, do you
    have any knee injuries or something like that?' Then they would look at me
    and say, 'No, why? I have no knee injury at all... my knees feel great. Why
    are you asking?' I said, 'Well because your thighs look a little slimmer to
    me. I thought maybe you can't squat, or maybe there's some problem with leg
    extension.' And then I'd see him for all 2 hours in the gym, always going in
    front of the mirror and chicking out his thighs... People are vulnerable
    about those things.

### Derek Sivers
* 184 Derek Sivers (@sivers) is one of my favorite humans, and I often call him
    for advice. Think of him as a philosopher-king, programmer, master teacher,
    and merry prankster.
* 187 "So many opportunities, and 10 years of stage experience, came from that
    one piddly little pig show... When you're earlier in your career, I think
    the best strategy is to just say 'yes' to everything. Every little gig. You
    just never know what are the lottery tickets."
* 189 You need to figure out whether you're feeling like, "Fuck yeah!" or "No."
    "Because most of us say yes to too much stuff, and then, we let these
    little, mediocre things fill our lives...The problem is, when that
    occasional, 'Oh my God, hell yeah!' thing comes along, you don't have
    enough time to give it attention that you should, because you've said yes to
    too much other little, half-ass stuff, right?

### Alexis Ohanian
* 194 Alexis Ohanian (@alexisohanian) is perhaps best known for being a
    co-founder of Reddit and Hipmunk. He was in the very first class of Y
    combinator, arguably the world's most selective startup "accelerator," where
    he is now a partner.
* 195 "I [had] and executive at Yahoo! who brought me and Steve in [for a
    potential axqisition discussion]--this was earli in Reddit-- and told us we
    were a rounding error because our traffic was so small...I put, 'You are a
    rounding error,' on our wall in the Reddit office after that meeting as a
    wall of negative reinforcement for me.

### Matt Mullenweg
* 202 Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) has been named on of *BussinessWeek's* 25 Most
    Influetial People on the Web, but I think that's an understatement. He is
    best known as the original lead developer of WordPress, which now powers
    more than 25% of the entire web.
* 204 "Actually, I lost one of our initial investment checks. It was a check for
    $400,000."

### Nicholas McCarthy
* 208 Nicholas McCarthy (@NMcCarthyPiano) was born in 1989 without his right
    hand and started to play the piano at the age of 14. He was told he would
    never succeed as a concert pianist. The doubters were wrong. His graduation
    from the prestigious Royal College of Music in London in 2012 appeared in
    press around the world, as he became the only one-handed pianist to graduate
    from the Royal College of Music in its 130-year history.
* 209 I now routinely listen to her. To have your mind explode, search
    "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No 1 FULL Argerich Charles Dutoit" and check out
    minute 31.

### Tony Robbins
* 210 Tony Robbins (@TonyRobbins) is the world's most famous performance coach.
    He's advised everyone from Bill Clinton and Serena Williams to Leonardo
    DiCaprio and Oprah (who calls him "superhuman").
* 213 The first 3 minutes: "Feeling totally grateful for three things. I make
    sure that one of them is very, very simple: the wind on my face, the
    relection of the clouds that I just saw. But I don't just think gratitude. I
    let gratitude fill my soul, because when you're grateful, we all know
    there's no anger. It's impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously.
    When you're grateful, there is no fear. You can't be fearful and grateful
    simultaneously."

### Casey Neistat
* 217 Casey Neistat (@CaseyNeistat) is a New York-based filmmaker and YouTuber.
    Casey ran away from home at 15 and had his first child at 17. He went on
    welfare to get free milk and diapers and never asked his parents for money
    again.
* 219 "You realize that you will never be the best-looking person in the room.
    You'll never be the smartest person in the room. You'll never be the most
    educated, the most well-versed. You can never compete on those levels. But
    what you can always compete on, the true egalitarian aspect to success, is
    hard work. You can always work harder than the next guy."

### Morgan Spurlock
* 221 Morgan Spurlock (@morganspurlock) is an Oscar-nominated documentary
    filmmaker based in New York. He is a prolific writer, director, producer,
    and human guinea pig.
* 222 "I was sitting on my mom's couch in a spectacular tryptophan haze, when a
    news story came about these two girls who were suing McDonald's. These girls
    said, 'We're fat, we're sick, and it's your fault.' I thought, 'Come on,
    that's crazy. You're goin to sue somebody for selling you food that you
    bought, that you ate, and then blame them for it? How can you do that?'"

### Reid Hoffman
* 228 Reid Hoffman (@reidhoffman) is often referred to as "The ORacle of Silicon
    Valley" by tech insiders, who look at his company-building and investing
    track recod (Facebook, Airbnb, Flickr, etc.) with awe. Reid is co-founder
