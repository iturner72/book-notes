## Introduction

* xxi I see the history of the internet as unfolding in three acts. Each act is
  marked by a predominating network architecture. In the first act, called the
  "read era," circa 1990 to 2005, early internet protocol networks
  *democratized information*. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser
  and read about almost any topic through websites. In the second act the
  "read-write era," roughly 2006 to 2020, corporate networks *democratized
  publishing*. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on
  social networks and other services. Now a new type of architecture is enabling
  the internet's third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of
  the two prior types, and it is *democratizing ownership*. In the dawning
  "read-write-own era," anyone can become a network stakeholder, gaining power
  and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate
  affiliates, like stockholders and employees. This new era promises to
  counteract Big Tech consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic
  roots. People can read and write on the internet, but they can also now *own*.

* xxviii The decisions we make now will determine the internet's future: who
  builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience
  will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the
  extraordinary power of software as an art form, with the internet as its
  canvas. The movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to
  remake humanity's relationship to the digital, to reimagine what's possible.
  Anyone can participate--whether you're a developer, creator, entrepreneur, or
  user. This is a chance to create the internet you want, not the internet you
  inherited.

## Part One: Read. Write.

### Chapter 1. Why Networks Matter

* 3 Network design is destiny. Networks are the organizing framework that
  enables billions of people to intelligibly interact. They decide the world's
  winners and losers. Their algorithms decide where money and attention will
  flow. The structure of a network guides how that network will evolve and where
  wealth and power accumulate. Given the scale of the internet today, software
  design decisions up front, regardless of how seemingly small, can have
  cascading downstream consequences. Who controls a given network is the central
  question when analyzing power on the internet.

* 7 Network effects dictate that the value of a network grows with the addition
  of each new node, or connection point. Nodes can be telephone lines,
  transportation hubs like airports, connection oriented technologies like
  computers, or even people. Metcalfe's law, one well-known formulation of the
  network effect, stipulates that the value of a network grows quadratically,
  meaning proportional to the number of nodes squared. For the mathematically
  minded, a network with ten nodes would be twenty-five times as valuable as a
  network with two nodes, while a network with a hundred nodes would be a
  hundred times as valuable as one with ten nodes, and so on. The law takes its
  name from Robert Metcalfe, a co-creator of Ethernet and the electronics maker
  3Com who popularized the idea in the 1980s.

### Chapter 2. Protocol Networks

* 8 In the fall of 1969, the U.S. military bootstrapped the earliest version of
  the internet: ARPANET, named after the Department of Defense's Advanced
  Research Projects Agency (ARPA). A broad community of researchers and
  developers spearheaded the internet's development through the next couple
  decades. THese academics and tinkerers brought with them a tradition of open
  access. They believed in the free exchange of ideas, equal opportunity, and
  meritocracy. In their view, the people who used internes services should have
  control. THe structure and governance of their reserarch communities, advisory
  groups, and task forces embodied their democratic ideals.

* 9 That same sporit infused the technology itself. THe internet was underpinned
  by permissionless protocols, sets of rules for computers to participate in
  networks. In ancient times, "rotocol," from the Greek *protokollon*, meant
  "first sheet of a volume," often referring to a table of contents. Over time,
  the word evolved to mean "diplomatic conventions" and, later, in the twentieth
  century, "technical standards for software." The computing context became
  widespread with the advent of ARPANET because protocols were foundational to
  the development of the internet.

* 24 RSS expected too much from users. Like email and the web, the protocol used
  DNS for naming, but that meant content creators had to pay to register domains
  and then transfer those domains to their own web servers or RSS hosting
  providers. This onboarding experience was fine for email and the web back in
  the early days of the internet, when there were no alternatives and when many
  users were technologists who were accustomed to putting in the effort. But as
  people with less willingness and know-how came online, RSS couldn't compete.
  Free, streamlined services like Twitter and Facebook offered easier ways for
  people to publish, connect, and consume, enabling them to amass tens, then
  hundreds of millions--and in Facebook's case, billions--of users.

### Chapter 3. Corporate Networks

* 28 Technology that borrows from what came before is sometimes called
  skeuomorphic. The term originally referred to design departments in art that
  are intentional, albeit unnecessary, holdovers. During the Steve Jobs era,
  Apple popularized the idea as a description of digital graphics that look like
  familiar objects, like a wood-grained bookshelf as decoration in a reading app
  or a trach can icon to represent deleted files.

* 30 Corporate networks have a simple structure. In the middle, a company
  controls centralized services that power the network. This company has
  complete control. It can rewrite its terms of service, determine who has
  access, and redirect how money flows, at any time, for any reason. Corporate
  networks are centralized because there is ultimately one person, usually the
  chief executive officer, who makes all the rules.

* 40 Almost all new technologies follow an "S-curve," a growth-over-time chart
  that resembles the letter S. THe curve starts out flat in the first phase, as
  a technology's developers search for a market and find early adopters. As the
  builders find product-market fit, the curve begins to tilt up quickly,
  reflecting mainstream uptake. The cure then flattens again as the product
  saturates the market.

## Part Two: Own.

### Chapter 4. Blockchains

* 49  Why do portable internet-connected supercomputers arrive, in reality,
  before flying cars? Why do computers and the internet improve so much faster
  than everything else? The explanation is partly technological. The laws of
  phusics allow us to shrink transisters, the smallest unit of computing
  machinery, and therefore pack more computing power into smaller valumes. The
  rate that describes the process is known as Moore's law, named after Gordon
  Moore, a founder of the chip company Intel. Moore's law states that the number
  of transistors that can fir on chips roughly doubles every two years. History
  proves the rule: a modern iPhone has more than 15 billion transistors,
  compared with a 1993 desktop PC, which has only about 3.5 million. Very few
  technologies experience more than a thousand times improvements like this.
  The physical constraints in other engineering fields are harder to overcome.

* 54 Hobbies fuel future industries. Open-source software started as a niche
  anti-copyright movement before going mainstream. Social media began as a
  pastime among idealistic blogging enthusiasts before the world embraced the
  idea. That T-shirt- and flip-flop-wearing hibbyists spawn large industries may
  seem like an amusing eccentricity of the tech industry, but hobbies are
  important for a reason. Businesspeople vote with their dollars: they are
  mostly trying to create near-term financial returns. Engineers vote with their
  time: they are mostly trying to invent interesting new things. Hobbies are
  what the smartest people spend time on when they aren't constreined by
  near-term financial goals. I like to say that what the smartest people do on
  the weekends is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years.

### Chapter 5. Tokens

* 70 Blockchains are multiplayer. They let kyou write code that makes strong
  commitments. Individuals and organizations don't have much need to make
  commitments to themselves. That's why attempts to create "enterprise
  blockchains," which function exclusively inside existing corporate
  organizations, haven't been successful. Blockchains are useful for enabling
  coordination among people who don't have preexisting relationships. They are
  most useful when they are not just multiplayer but *massively*
  multiplayer--inbroad use across the internet.

* 72 Tokens can represent the ownership of anything digital, including money,
  art, photos, music, text, code, game items, voting power, access, or whatever
  people come up with next. Using some additional building blocks, they can also
  represent real-world things, like physical goods, real estate, or dollars in a
  bank account. Anything that can be represented in code can be wrapped inside
  a token to be bought, sold, used, stored, embedded, transferred, or whatever
  else a person might want to do with it. If that sounds so simple as to seem
      trivial, that's by design. Simplicity is a virtue.

* 75 One common misconception is that stablecoinns pose a threat to the status
  of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. In fact, the opposite
  appears to be true. Demand for internet native dollars is so strong that most
  stablecoin issuers have opted to peg their stablecoins to the U.S. dollar.
  U.S. congressman Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Financial
  Services Committee, which monitors stablecoinnd adoption, has argued that the
  technology "reinforces rather than challenges the supremacy of the U.S.
  dollar" and has "enabled the U.S. to outcompete countries like China in the
  realm of digital currencies even without a CBDC," an abbreviation for "central
  bank digital currency." (So far, the U.S. government has no CBDC, whereas the
  People's Bank of China mints a digital renminbi.)

### Chapter 6. Blockchain Networks

* 86 What makes a great city? The world's best metropolises are a mix of public
  and private spaces. Parks, sidewalks, and other shared spaces attract visitors
  and improve daily life. PRivate spaces create incentives for people to build
  businesses, adding variety and essential services. A city with only public
  spaces would lack the creative vitalityu that entrepreneurs bring. A city
  owned by a private company would, in contrast, be a soulless simulacrum.

* 87 The internet should feature the same balance between public and private
  spaces as seen in healthy cities. Corporate networks are like private real
  estate that entrepreneurs can develop. They are nimble and resourceful. But
  their success can subsume the commons, crowd out alternatives. and reduce
  opportunities for users, creators, and entrepreneurs.

## Part Three: A New Era

### Chapter 7. Community-Created Software

* 101 Until the 1970s, being in the tech business meant selling hardware,
  including microchips, data storage, and computers. Then a contrarian idea
  popped into the head of a shrewd kid. What if software could be a good
  business? In fact, what if it could be a great business--even *better* than
  hardware? Compelled to test the theory, the guy abandoned plans for law
  school, dropped out of college, and founded Microsoft.

* 106 Composability refers to a property of software that allows smaller pieces
  to be assembled into large compositions. Composability depends on
  interoperability, but it takes the idea further by combining systems the way
  one builds using Lego bricks, as mentioned in "Tokens." Composiong software is
  like making music or writing, where larger creations, like symphonies or
  novels, are composed of smaller parts, like strings of notes or words.

* 110 As corporate networks grow, their interests shift away from being open to
  being closed. It's naive to count on a company not to be evil just because its
  motto it "Don't be evil." Companies will generally do whatever it takes to
  maximize profits. If they don't, they won't last long as they'll fall behind
  other companies that do. Blockchain networks turn "Don't be evil" into
  "Can't be evil." Their architecture provides strong guarantees that their data
  and code will forever remain open and remixable. The debate between the
  monolithic design or corporate networks and the composability-friendly design
  of blockchain networks mirrors a similar debate in the 1990s over the design
  of operating systems. In his famous 1999 essay, "The Cathedral and the
  Bazaar," the programmer and open-source software advocate Eric Raymond
  contrasts two models of software development. In the first model, popularized
  by closed-source companies like Microsoft, software is "built like cathedrals,
  carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in
  splendid isolation." In the second model, popularized by open-souce projects
  like Linux, the community seems "to resemble a greate babbling bazaar of
  differing agendas and approaches," and the guiding philosophy is "release
  early and often, delegate everthing you can, be open to the point of
  promiscuity."

### Chapter 8. Takes Rates

* 112 If you were an executive at an established business and you heard some
  hotshot dot-com founded utter the above threat in the mid-1990s (Your margin
  is my opportunity). Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was referring, without
  embellishment, to his strategy for seizing market share. The plan: minimize
  overhead, slash prices, eat rivals; profits. Be lean, be mean. Be relentless.

* 114 Apple has extraordinary pricing power thanks to its captive audience of
  iPhone users combinded with the network effect derived from the iOS developer
  ecosystem. Apple exercises this power through strict rules around payments,
  which the companies subject to them loathe. Ever try to subscribe to Spotify
  or buy an Amazon Kindle book via an iOS app? You can't. These businesses don't
  want to pay Apple's take rate, which can run as high as 30 percent. A common
  work-around app developers use to circumvent Apple is to accept payments only
  in mobile web browsers, not in apps. On a technical level, Apple could never
  override this bypass and force all transactions to route through the App
  Store, but Apple hasn't dared to clamp down here. No doubt there would be a
  strong backlash, and propably legal and regulatory ramifications.

### Chapter 9. Building Networks with Token Incentives

* 128 It's telling that the most successful protocol networks were funded by
  government programs in the 1970s and 1980s, before the arrival of teh
  commercial internet. Email and the web prospered absent corporate network
  competition. To quote *The Cluetrain Manifesto*, a book published in 2000 that
  describes how the internet had changed business (and much else): "THe Net grew
  like a week between the cracks in the monolithic steel-and-glass empire of
  traditional commerce." The internet flourished, the authors continue, "largely
  because it was ignored."

* 134 That is, until one. An experimental blockchain project, Helium, got
  further than anyone else. The network encouraged people to install and run
  access points in exchange for token rewards, enabling it to reac hnationwide
  coverage in a few years. The project still has lots of work to do to build out
  the demand side of the network. (The initial network was based on an esoteric
  networking standard, but it has since upgraded to 5G cellular, a much more
  popular option.) But Helium built the supply side of the network for a
  grassroots telecom service much more successfully than previous
  attempts--proof of token incentives' potential.

### Chapter 10. Tokenomics

* 141 Designing systems of incentives to underpin blockchain networks is
  sometimes known as tokenomics--a blend of, you guessed it, "tokens" and
  "economics." While tokenomics may sound like something entirely new, it's
  novel only insofar as it applies old concepts to the context of the internet.
  Conceptually, there's nothing that gorundbreaking. Tokenomics mostly just
  encompasses economics. (Practitioners also call the discipline protocol
  design, but I avoid this to prevent confusion with early internet-style
  protocol networks.)

* 142 Tokenomic designs in blockchain networks build on lessons learned in video
  games. A blockchain economy, like any healthy virtual economy, hsould balance
  the supply and demand of native tokens to fuel sustainable growth. A
  well-designed token economy helps the network flourish. The right incentives
  turn users into communities of owners and contributors.

* 150 Another way of lokking at the course of tech innovation is through the
  "hype cycle," a management framework the consulting firm Gartner made popular
  starting in 1995. Gartner's model builds on the work of other thinkers, like
  the economist Joseph Schumpeter, known for his theory of creative destruction.
  The model illustrates how when a new technology arrives, the excitement it
  generates can catalyze a financial bubble (the peak of inflated expectations).
  A crash usually follows (the trough of disillusionment). Then there's a long
  period of productive growth as the technology gets broadly deployed (the slope
  of enlightenment). The hype cycle has played out many times across many
  technologies, including railroads, electricity, and automobiles. Take the
  internet, for instance. Dot-com mania climbed toward its "peak of inflated
  expectations" in the 1990s. A slew of overpriced IPOs came out of that era,
  but so did several legitimate and wildly successful companies. After the early
  2000s' "trough of disillusionment," two steady decades followed along the
  "slope of enlightenment," bringing internet valuations back to new highs, this
  time driven by fundamentals. Any skeptic who dismissed dot-coms as magic beans
  would have missed out on the successes of Google, Amazon, and others.

### Chapter 11. Network Governance

* 154 The internet's core protocol networks approximate a democracy. At their
  foundation, developers weigh in on and implement technical standards. Many
  developers are independent and free to make their own choices, or they are
  part of larger companies that make clieant applications. If someone proposes
  to change an existing protocol or invent a new one, it's up to developers and
  businesses to put the ideas into practice. Proposals are just that, proposals.

* 154 At a higher level, internet governance emerges from an organizational
  patwork of techincal standards coordinators. The World Wide Web Consortium
  (W3C), an international nonprofit, provides a forum for hundreds of member
  organizations, including research insitutions, governement groups, small
  ocmpanies, and big corporations, to discuss web-related standards. The
  volunteer-only Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), part of the seperate
  nonprofit Internet Society, maintains standards for internet protocols like
  email. ICANN, yet another nonprofit, oversees the internet's name space,
  including by allocating IP addresses, accrediting domain name registrars, and
  adjudicating disputes over trademarks and other legal matters. Except for
  ICANN, these organizations are not really governing bodies. Yes, they set
  protocol standards and convene discussions but, for the most part, they issue
  recommendations, not edicts.

## Part Four: Here and Now

### Chapter 12. The Computer versus the Casino

* 173 Securities are the subset of the world's traded assets where investors are
  reliant on a small group of people, usually a management team, to generate a
  return on their investment. Securities laws are designed to reduce risks that
  arise from this dependency by, among other things, applying disclosure
  obligations to securities issuers, as well as to certain other parties that
  transact in securities.

* 174 Tokens are digital building blocks, analogous to how websites are digital
  building blocks. Imagine if every time you wanted to use an internet service
  that used tokens as securities you had to go through the process you currently
  go through when buying a share of equity. Rather than just opening a social
  media app and scrolling, you would first have to log in to your brokerage
  account and place an order to purchase tokens. Want to use that app? Sign this
  paperwork and wait for your order to settle.

* 176 What precisely does it mean to be sufficiently decentralized? The best
  guidlines come from regulations and court precedents from the pre-internet
  era. The most famous is a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that created what's
  called the Howey test for deciding what constitutes an "investment contract,"
  another term for a security. The Howey test consists of three elements, or
  prongs. APplied to digital assets, the test looks at whether an offer or sale
  of digital assets involves (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common
  entreprise, (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit to be derived from the
  efforts of others. All three prongs must be met for the offer or sale of a
  digital asset to be considered a securities transaction.

* 178 Sometimes people ask if it's possible to get the benefits of blockchains
  while removing any hint of teh casino by making tokens impossible to trade,
  through either legal or technical means. If you remove the ability to buy
  or sell something, however, you remover ownership. Even intangibles, like
  copyrights and intellectual property, can be bought and sold at their
  owners' discretion. No trading means no ownership; you can't have on
  without the other.

## Part Five: What's Next?

### Chapter 13. The iPhone Moment: From Incubation to Growth

* 185 It can take years, decades even, for new computing platforms to go from
  prototype to mainstream adoption. This is true for hardware-based computers
  like PCs, mobile phones, and VR headsets, and it's also true for
  software-based virtual computers like blockchains and AI systems. After years
  of false starts, someone releases a breakthrough product that kicks off a
  period of exponential growth.

* 187 Another important skeuomorphic category will likely be financial networks.
  Sending money should be as easy as sending text messages. Improving how
  payments work is mostly a collective action problem, something blockchains are
  well suited to solve. Blockchain-based payment systems could lower fees,
  reduce friction, and unlock new categories of applications.

### Chapter 14. Come Promising Applications

* 189 To be a successful creator you don't need millions. You don't need millions of
  dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To
  make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author,
  animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true
  fans.

* 196 Time Sweeney, the founder of Epic, the maker of *Fortnite* and the popular
  engine Unreal, describes his vision of an open metaverse as a combination of
  the two: We need several things. We need a file format for representing 3D
  content. You need a protocol for exchanging it, which could be HTTPS or
  something like the Interplanetary File System, which is decentralized and open
  to everyone. You need a means of performing secure commerce, which could be
  the blockchain, and you need a realtime protocol for sending and receiving
  positions of objects in the world and facial motion.

* 211 Although internet payments are now common, they are still high friction.
  Users have to enter credit card information. Incidents of fraud and
  charge-backs are high. Credit card fees are between 2 and 3 percent, low by
  the standards of other internet take rates, but high enough to prohibit many
  possible uses.

* 214 Ethereum offers another option. Systems built on top of Ethereum, like
  so-called rollups, also lower transaciton costs and improve latency. People
  can use a dollar-pegged stablecoin like USDC to avoid price volatility.
  Sending money with USDC on Ethereum is usally faster and cheaper than using
  bank wires. WHile the transaction fees are still too high to handle smaller,
  everyday, payments, this should improve as more scaling solutions come online,
  boosted by Ethereum's platform-app feedback loop.

* 214 These problems are similar to ones that affected phone calls and text
  messages prior to smartphones. Users had to pay for calls by the minute and
  texts by the message, and international fees were high. The problems were
  fixed when applications like WhatsApp and FaceTime created new networks to
  replace older networks. A new global payment network could do the same for
  money.

* 223 Regulation also won't solve the real problem: the internet's lack of an
  effective reputation system. Instead of holding techology back, a better
  solution is to push it forward. We should build systems that allow users and
  applications to verify the authenticity of media. One idea is to allow
  "attestations" --claims backed up by cryptographic digital signatures-- on
  blockchains where users and orgs can vouch for individual pieces of media.
  Here's how that might work. THe author of a vid, pic, or audio track could
  digitally sign a media identifierm, alled a hash, saying, "I created this
  content." Another organization, like a media company, could add to that
  attestation by signing a transaciton that says, "I attest that this content is
  authentic." Users could itentify themselves in the signatures by
  cryptographically providing control of domain names (for example,
  nytimes.com), newer identifiers tied to blockchain-based naming services like
  Ethereum Name Service (nytimes.eth), or usernames on older identity systems
  like Facebook and Twitter (@nytimes).

## Conclusion

* 229 Another tailwind driving blockchain networks forward is a wave of new
  talent entering the tech industry as the next generation looks to put its mark
  on the internet. In every generational change, there are people who want to do
  more than just work on technology for its own sake. They want to set out on
  their own and shake things up and challenge incumbents. I see this firsthand
  at my firm. Every year, thousands of students and others early in their
  careers come to me and my partners to collaborate on blockchain projects. When
  we ask why, they tell us they don't want to spend their careers helping Google
  or Meta sell more ads. They want to work on the frontier.
