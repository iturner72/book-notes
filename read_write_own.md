## Introduction

* xxi I see the history of the internet as unfolding in three acts. Each act is
  marked by a predominating network architecture. In the first act, called the
  "read era," circa 1990 to 2005, early internet protocol networks
  *democratized information*. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser
  and read about almost any topic through websites. In the second act the
  "read-write era," roughly 2006 to 2020, corporate networks *democratized
  publishing*. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on
  social networks and other services. Now a new type of architecture is enabling
  the internet's third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of
  the two prior types, and it is *democratizing ownership*. In the dawning
  "read-write-own era," anyone can become a network stakeholder, gaining power
  and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate
  affiliates, like stockholders and employees. This new era promises to
  counteract Big Tech consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic
  roots. People can read and write on the internet, but they can also now *own*.

* xxviii The decisions we make now will determine the internet's future: who
  builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience
  will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the
  extraordinary power of software as an art form, with the internet as its
  canvas. The movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to
  remake humanity's relationship to the digital, to reimagine what's possible.
  Anyone can participate--whether you're a developer, creator, entrepreneur, or
  user. This is a chance to create the internet you want, not the internet you
  inherited.

## Part One: Read. Write.

### Chapter 1. Why Networks Matter

* 3 Network design is destiny. Networks are the organizing framework that
  enables billions of people to intelligibly interact. They decide the world's
  winners and losers. Their algorithms decide where money and attention will
  flow. The structure of a network guides how that network will evolve and where
  wealth and power accumulate. Given the scale of the internet today, software
  design decisions up front, regardless of how seemingly small, can have
  cascading downstream consequences. Who controls a given network is the central
  question when analyzing power on the internet.

* 7 Network effects dictate that the value of a network grows with the addition
  of each new node, or connection point. Nodes can be telephone lines,
  transportation hubs like airports, connection oriented technologies like
  computers, or even people. Metcalfe's law, one well-known formulation of the
  network effect, stipulates that the value of a network grows quadratically,
  meaning proportional to the number of nodes squared. For the mathematically
  minded, a network with ten nodes would be twenty-five times as valuable as a
  network with two nodes, while a network with a hundred nodes would be a
  hundred times as valuable as one with ten nodes, and so on. The law takes its
  name from Robert Metcalfe, a co-creator of Ethernet and the electronics maker
  3Com who popularized the idea in the 1980s.

### Chapter 2. Protocol Networks

* 8 In the fall of 1969, the U.S. military bootstrapped the earliest version of
  the internet: ARPANET, named after the Department of Defense's Advanced
  Research Projects Agency (ARPA). A broad community of researchers and
  developers spearheaded the internet's development through the next couple
  decades. THese academics and tinkerers brought with them a tradition of open
  access. They believed in the free exchange of ideas, equal opportunity, and
  meritocracy. In their view, the people who used internes services should have
  control. THe structure and governance of their reserarch communities, advisory
  groups, and task forces embodied their democratic ideals.

* 9 That same sporit infused the technology itself. THe internet was underpinned
  by permissionless protocols, sets of rules for computers to participate in
  networks. In ancient times, "rotocol," from the Greek *protokollon*, meant
  "first sheet of a volume," often referring to a table of contents. Over time,
  the word evolved to mean "diplomatic conventions" and, later, in the twentieth
  century, "technical standards for software." The computing context became
  widespread with the advent of ARPANET because protocols were foundational to
  the development of the internet.

* 24 RSS expected too much from users. Like email and the web, the protocol used
  DNS for naming, but that meant content creators had to pay to register domains
  and then transfer those domains to their own web servers or RSS hosting
  providers. This onboarding experience was fine for email and the web back in
  the early days of the internet, when there were no alternatives and when many
  users were technologists who were accustomed to putting in the effort. But as
  people with less willingness and know-how came online, RSS couldn't compete.
  Free, streamlined services like Twitter and Facebook offered easier ways for
  people to publish, connect, and consume, enabling them to amass tens, then
  hundreds of millions--and in Facebook's case, billions--of users.

### Chapter 3. Corporate Networks

* 28 Technology that borrows from what came before is sometimes called
  skeuomorphic. The term originally referred to design departments in art that
  are intentional, albeit unnecessary, holdovers. During the Steve Jobs era,
  Apple popularized the idea as a description of digital graphics that look like
  familiar objects, like a wood-grained bookshelf as decoration in a reading app
  or a trach can icon to represent deleted files.

* 30 Corporate networks have a simple structure. In the middle, a company
  controls centralized services that power the network. This company has
  complete control. It can rewrite its terms of service, determine who has
  access, and redirect how money flows, at any time, for any reason. Corporate
  networks are centralized because there is ultimately one person, usually the
  chief executive officer, who makes all the rules.

* 40 Almost all new technologies follow an "S-curve," a growth-over-time chart
  that resembles the letter S. THe curve starts out flat in the first phase, as
  a technology's developers search for a market and find early adopters. As the
  builders find product-market fit, the curve begins to tilt up quickly,
  reflecting mainstream uptake. The cure then flattens again as the product
  saturates the market.

## Part Two: Own.
