### Introduction: The Gatekeeper
* 1 Regulation and law currently put American citizens at second remove from
  therapeutic medicines. In order to use most drugs, citizens must obtain a
  prescription from a licensed and qualified medical authority, usually a
  physician. Yet before anyone can prescribe, the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration must approve. No new drug can be legally marketed in the United
  States unless the Administration has explicitly declared it "safe and
  effective" for its intended uses. This authority renders the FDA the
  gatekeeper of the American pharmaceutical marketplace, and it sustains a
  battery of vast powers. Among these are the power to define medical success
  and shape scientific careers, the power to limit advertising and product
  claims, the power to govern drug manufacturing, the power to enable drug firms
  to generate vast riches and the power to chase those same firms from the
  marketplace, the power to sculpt medical and scientific concepts, and
  ultimately the power to influence the lives and deaths of citizens. Some of
  those citizens may be harmed from hazardous or ineffective therapies that the
  FDA has approved. Other citizens may suffer or die waiting for the agency to
  approve a potentially effective cure. Still others, perhaps most, may easily
  use a drug whose dosage, label, and chemical form have be carefully honed
  through the scrutiny that regulation brings. Whatever the outcome, the FDA has
  shaped the lives of one and all. Among the thousands of people who daily give
  painstaking attention to the agency's every utterance and movement, there is
  considerable disagreement about the Food and Drug Administration &mdash; it is
  venerated in one corner and bemoaned in another; it is targeted for expansion
  by one voice, for evisceration by a second &mdash; but there is no serious doubt
  about its reach or significance.
* 3 A "blockbuster" is drug industry parlance for a highly lucrative drug,
  generally one that generates $1 billion per year or more in revenues. By
  reaping vast profits, a blockbuster drug like Activase can pay off hundreds of
  other, less fortunate wagers that a drug company has made upon promising but
  never-marketed therapies. 
* 3 In the spring of 1987, for many investors, all bets were literally off. The
  panel's decision on Friday, May 29, was a refusal to recommend licensing of
  Activase, and it presaged a more dramatic event; on June 15, the
  Administration would reject the drug for marketing in the United States.
  Genentech's share price quickly plunged by $11.50, to $36.75. In an instant,
  $928 million &mdash; nearly a quarter of the publicly traded value of the
  biotechnology industry's star company &mdash; had vanished.
* 6 The saga of tissue plasminogen activator is significant not merely as
  medical history, but as a canvas in which the politics of pharmaceutical
  regulation and government power are illuminated. A subtle request for
  information had derailed an entire industry's hopes, had erased millions of
  dollars in investment value, and had set in motion a wide-ranging controversy
  to which major national newspapers were devoting prime news and editorial
  pages.
* 6 None of thie import was lost on Genentech's executive at the time, G. Kirfk
  Raab. Raab was hired specifically to smooth the company's journey through the
  regulatory process. Years later, Raab would describe regulatory approval for
  his products as the fundamental challenge facing his company. And he would
  depict the Administration in a particularly vivid metaphor. "I've told a story
  hundreds of times to help people understand the FDA. When I was in Brazil I
  worked on the Amazon River for many months selling Terramycin for Pfizer. I
  hadn't seen my family for eight or nine months. They were flying to Sao
  Paulo, and I was flying down from some little village on the Amazon to Manous
  and then to Sao Paulo. I was a young guy in his twenties. I couldn't wait to
  see the kids. One of them was a year-old baby, the other was three. I missed
  my wife. There was a quonset hut in front of just a little dirt strip with a
  single engine plane to fly me to Manous. I roll up and there is a Brazillian
  soldier standing there. The military revolution had happened literally the
  week before. So this soldier is standing there with this machine gun and he
  said to me: 'You can't come in.' I was speaking pretty good Portuguese by that
  time. I said: 'My god, my plane, my family, I gotta come in!' He said again:
  'You can't come in.' I said: 'I gotta come in!' And he took his machine gun,
  took the safety off, and pointed it at me, and said: 'You can't come in.' And
  I said: 'Oh, now I got it. I can't go in there.' And that's the way I always
  describe the FDA. The FDA is standing there with a machine gun against the
  pharmaceutical industry, so you better be their friend rather than their enemy.
  They are the boss. If you're a pharmaceutical firm, they own you body and
  soul.
* 8 The chronicle of tissue plasminogen activator leaves puzzles that beg for
  explanation and inquiry. How is it that in the United States, long known as
  the land of weak regulation, smaller government, and powerful business, a
  regulatory agency &mdash; any regulatory *any* regulatory agency &mdash; could
  "own you body and soul"? How could a government agency literally reshape the
  content and method of scientific research? How could such an agency exercise
  such vast sway over sectors &mdash; including financial markets and the
  industry of research and development&mdash; that it did not directly govern?
  How in the United States &mdash; a society characterized by the distrust of
  government power, and at no time more starkly than in the 1980s during the 
  presidency of Ronald Reagan &mdash;  could a federal regulatory agency have
  an enviable public reputation that commentators on the left and right duly
  recognized? How could such a reputation endure through criticism by
  scientists, by corporations, by major newspapers? Perhaps more important, how
  could an agency inspire admiration from society while also being feared by
  some of its most powerful members?
