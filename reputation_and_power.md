## Introduction: The Gatekeeper
* 1 Regulation and law currently put American citizens at second remove from
  therapeutic medicines. In order to use most drugs, citizens must obtain a
  prescription from a licensed and qualified medical authority, usually a
  physician. Yet before anyone can prescribe, the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration must approve. No new drug can be legally marketed in the United
  States unless the Administration has explicitly declared it "safe and
  effective" for its intended uses. This authority renders the FDA the
  gatekeeper of the American pharmaceutical marketplace, and it sustains a
  battery of vast powers. Among these are the power to define medical success
  and shape scientific careers, the power to limit advertising and product
  claims, the power to govern drug manufacturing, the power to enable drug firms
  to generate vast riches and the power to chase those same firms from the
  marketplace, the power to sculpt medical and scientific concepts, and
  ultimately the power to influence the lives and deaths of citizens. Some of
  those citizens may be harmed from hazardous or ineffective therapies that the
  FDA has approved. Other citizens may suffer or die waiting for the agency to
  approve a potentially effective cure. Still others, perhaps most, may easily
  use a drug whose dosage, label, and chemical form have be carefully honed
  through the scrutiny that regulation brings. Whatever the outcome, the FDA has
  shaped the lives of one and all. Among the thousands of people who daily give
  painstaking attention to the agency's every utterance and movement, there is
  considerable disagreement about the Food and Drug Administration &mdash; it is
  venerated in one corner and bemoaned in another; it is targeted for expansion
  by one voice, for evisceration by a second &mdash; but there is no serious doubt
  about its reach or significance.
* 3 A "blockbuster" is drug industry parlance for a highly lucrative drug,
  generally one that generates $1 billion per year or more in revenues. By
  reaping vast profits, a blockbuster drug like Activase can pay off hundreds of
  other, less fortunate wagers that a drug company has made upon promising but
  never-marketed therapies. 
* 3 In the spring of 1987, for many investors, all bets were literally off. The
  panel's decision on Friday, May 29, was a refusal to recommend licensing of
  Activase, and it presaged a more dramatic event; on June 15, the
  Administration would reject the drug for marketing in the United States.
  Genentech's share price quickly plunged by $11.50, to $36.75. In an instant,
  $928 million &mdash; nearly a quarter of the publicly traded value of the
  biotechnology industry's star company &mdash; had vanished.
* 6 The saga of tissue plasminogen activator is significant not merely as
  medical history, but as a canvas in which the politics of pharmaceutical
  regulation and government power are illuminated. A subtle request for
  information had derailed an entire industry's hopes, had erased millions of
  dollars in investment value, and had set in motion a wide-ranging controversy
  to which major national newspapers were devoting prime news and editorial
  pages.
* 6 None of thie import was lost on Genentech's executive at the time, G. Kirfk
  Raab. Raab was hired specifically to smooth the company's journey through the
  regulatory process. Years later, Raab would describe regulatory approval for
  his products as the fundamental challenge facing his company. And he would
  depict the Administration in a particularly vivid metaphor. "I've told a story
  hundreds of times to help people understand the FDA. When I was in Brazil I
  worked on the Amazon River for many months selling Terramycin for Pfizer. I
  hadn't seen my family for eight or nine months. They were flying to Sao
  Paulo, and I was flying down from some little village on the Amazon to Manous
  and then to Sao Paulo. I was a young guy in his twenties. I couldn't wait to
  see the kids. One of them was a year-old baby, the other was three. I missed
  my wife. There was a quonset hut in front of just a little dirt strip with a
  single engine plane to fly me to Manous. I roll up and there is a Brazillian
  soldier standing there. The military revolution had happened literally the
  week before. So this soldier is standing there with this machine gun and he
  said to me: 'You can't come in.' I was speaking pretty good Portuguese by that
  time. I said: 'My god, my plane, my family, I gotta come in!' He said again:
  'You can't come in.' I said: 'I gotta come in!' And he took his machine gun,
  took the safety off, and pointed it at me, and said: 'You can't come in.' And
  I said: 'Oh, now I got it. I can't go in there.' And that's the way I always
  describe the FDA. The FDA is standing there with a machine gun against the
  pharmaceutical industry, so you better be their friend rather than their enemy.
  They are the boss. If you're a pharmaceutical firm, they own you body and
  soul.
* 8 The chronicle of tissue plasminogen activator leaves puzzles that beg for
  explanation and inquiry. How is it that in the United States, long known as
  the land of weak regulation, smaller government, and powerful business, a
  regulatory agency &mdash; any regulatory *any* regulatory agency &mdash; could
  "own you body and soul"? How could a government agency literally reshape the
  content and method of scientific research? How could such an agency exercise
  such vast sway over sectors &mdash; including financial markets and the
  industry of research and development&mdash; that it did not directly govern?
  How in the United States &mdash; a society characterized by the distrust of
  government power, and at no time more starkly than in the 1980s during the 
  presidency of Ronald Reagan &mdash;  could a federal regulatory agency have
  an enviable public reputation that commentators on the left and right duly
  recognized? How could such a reputation endure through criticism by
  scientists, by corporations, by major newspapers? Perhaps more important, how
  could an agency inspire admiration from society while also being feared by
  some of its most powerful members?

### Reputation and the Puzzles of Regulatory Power
* 10 Reputation &mdash; understood as a set of symbolic beliefs about an
  organization, beliefs embedded in multiple audiences &mdash; comprises the
  central response of this study to the puzzle of American regulatory power in
  the global pharmaceutical world. Reputation built on regulatory power in all
  of its facets. And power, once possessed, has been used and managed in ways
  that maintain reputation, and hence power itself. 
* 12 In the 1970s, as public opinion on government capacity soured, the FDA and
  its regulatory work regularly received 70 to 80 percent or more "approval" or
  "confidence" from citizens surveyed; this was double or more the confidence
  ascribed to the federal government, to Congress and various presidents of the
  time in the same surveys. (There's an insanely long footnote on this page that
  details the surprising (to me) survey results).

### Regulatory Power: Directive, Gatekeeping, and Conceptual
* 15 In representing regulatory power in the modern pharmaceutical world, I have
  chosen a threefold conception that harkens to an older tradition of inquiry in
  political science and sociology. The idea is that power exists not only in
  broad formal authority to direct the behavior of others (directive power) but
  also in appearances that are less obvious: the ability to define what sorts of
  problems, debates, and agendas structure human activity (gatekeeping power),
  and the ability to shape the content and structure of human cognition itself
  (conceptual power).

### The Scope and Variance of Regulatory Power: Some Comparative and Historical Riddles
* 19 An intensive study of one government agency may seem of limited value for
  understanding other organizations. Is a focused assay of American
  pharmaceutical regulation over seven decades a "case study" of an organization
  whose patterns illustrate those of other agencies, and if so, why not examine
  these other cases as co-equal recipients of attention? Or is the FDA so unique
  that its analysis speaks with limited range to other settings? I think neither
  of these concerns has warrant. The main problem comes with the term "case
  study" and its all too casual use in academic work. To call something a "case
  study" assumes the goal of extracting universal knowledge about a population
  from a singular entity. A study thus amounts to a "case" only when its
  characteristics are representative of those shared by a larger population of
  research objects; a pharmaceutical regulator in the United States could, under
  this reasoning, represent all other pharmaceutical regulators, all other
  government agencies, or even all other organizations[^1].

  [^1]: Historian of physics Peter Galison has rendered the point
  with hilarity: "Imagine a book entitled *A Case Study in European History:
  France*. 
* 21 The FDA has long employed more scientists and more heavily trained personnel
  than other agencies performing its functions, at times (in the 1970s) more so
  than in all the world's other drug regulators combined. Even as agencies in
  Europe and Asia have advanced in recent years, the United States still houses
  the strongest of global pharmaceutical regulators.
* 22 In the latter half of the twentieth century, an American model for
  pharmaceutical regulation has been perhaps the primary institutional export of
  the Unites States (see table I.1). (This table shows how other nations yoinked
  various US pharma regs like: New Drug Application (NDA), Regulated R&D (Phased
  Studies), Good Manufacturing Practices, and more).
* 25 Some fun puzzles:    
 + Why is pharmaceutical regulation nationalized in the US, while other forms of
   regulation are not? Put equivalently, why is pharmaceutical regulation
   nationalized in the US when other nations, most notably Australia and India,
   have had more decentralized, regional agencies that regulate medicines?
 + Why has the FDA enjoyed greater discretion, policymaking authority, and
   deference from other branches of government in its regulation of drugs,
   compared to its regulation of foods?
 + What accounts for some of the intricate and counterintuitive patterns of
   interplay between firms, scientists, federal regulators, and social groups in
   the US? And how does this most powerful agency exercise its power with such
   limited resources?

### Narrative, Comparison, and Statistics: Empirical Approaches of This Study
* 26 My goals will have been met if the book leaves readers with an appreciation
  for the historical and political complications of US pharmaceutical regulation
  as well as some general lenses through which the seemingly familiar can be
  viewed in a different, potentially surprising, and illuminating way.
* 26 Another reason for preserving and presenting the complexity of US
  pharmaceutical regulation is that most attempts at simplification &mdash; and
  there have been many &mdash; have been misleading. There are dozens of
  writings on US pharmaceutical regulation, and there are many, many more on
  prescription drugs and the American and global pharmaceutical industries.
  Those efforts, while collectively fascinating and occasionally enriching,
  often portray an all too simple landscape. In one common narrative, a
  government agency protects millions of citizens from unscrupulous businesses
  whose lust for profit vastly outweighs their concern for public health or
  consumer safety. In another account, much more popular in recent years, the
  agency has been taken over by the very companies it is supposed to govern,
  converted to a servant of industry. In other stories, an overzealous and
  illegitimate government regulator, subservient either to populist,
  anti-technology consumer advocates or to drug companies themselves, deprives
  patients of medicines that would save their lives, and suffocates the
  innovative technology coming from one of modern capitalism's most dynamic
  sectors. 
        At different moments, each of these narratives tells a partial truth.
  Cautious bureaucrats have bungled. Profit-thirsty firms have recklessly
  produced and poorly tested unsage drugs that have killed and maimed.
  Pharmaceutical firms have indeed exercised more sway over regulatory affairs
  in recent decades. Yet in the aggregate, and over the course of decades of
  American and global history, these stories fundamentally mislead. More
  compelling and accurate truths lie not merely in between these extremes, but
  on other dimensions of experience.

### The Subject, The Theory, and The Approach
* 30 ...in the analysis of reputation and power in regulation, it is not only
  the regulatory official but also her audiences and subjects that merit
  attention (perhaps most of it). 
* 30 Much of the study is focused not on newer forms of medical therapies but
  upon a set of drugs that the FDA has called "new molecular entities." In the
  pharmaceutical world, two categorical distinctions are often employed to break
  apart the continuous and slippery space of drugs. Molecular entities are
  usually distinguished from "biologics." The world of biologics is often
  wrongly conflated with the world of "biotech," when in fact most biotechnology
  drugs are not vaccines or otherwise bioactive. A more pervasive difference is
  between "small" and "large" molecules, such that the larger molecules
  represent proteins and antibodies that are "biologically active," whereas the
  smaller molecules stand in for more traditional drugs without biological
  activity.
