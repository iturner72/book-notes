### Introduction: The Gatekeeper
* 1 Regulation and law currently put American citizens at second remove from
  therapeutic medicines. In order to use most drugs, citizens must obtain a
  prescription from a licensed and qualified medical authority, usually a
  physician. Yet before anyone can prescribe, the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration must approve. No new drug can be legally marketed in the United
  States unless the Administration has explicitly declared it "safe and
  effective" for its intended uses. This authority renders the FDA the
  gatekeeper of the American pharmaceutical marketplace, and it sustains a
  battery of vast powers. Among these are the power to define medical success
  and shape scientific careers, the power to limit advertising and product
  claims, the power to govern drug manufacturing, the power to enable drug firms
  to generate vast riches and the power to chase those same firms from the
  marketplace, the power to sculpt medical and scientific concepts, and
  ultimately the power to influence the lives and deaths of citizens. Some of
  those citizens may be harmed from hazardous or ineffective therapies that the
  FDA has approved. Other citizens may suffer or die waiting for the agency to
  approve a potentially effective cure. Still others, perhaps most, may easily
  use a drug whose dosage, label, and chemical form have be carefully honed
  through the scrutiny that regulation brings. Whatever the outcome, the FDA has
  shaped the lives of one and all. Among the thousands of people who daily give
  painstaking attention to the agency's every utterance and movement, there is
  considerable disagreement about the Food and Drug Administration &mdash; it is
  venerated in one corner and bemoaned in another; it is targeted for expansion
  by one voice, for evisceration by a second &mdash; but there is no serious doubt
  about its reach or significance.
