## Introduction: The Gatekeeper
* 1 Regulation and law currently put American citizens at second remove from
  therapeutic medicines. In order to use most drugs, citizens must obtain a
  prescription from a licensed and qualified medical authority, usually a
  physician. Yet before anyone can prescribe, the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration must approve. No new drug can be legally marketed in the United
  States unless the Administration has explicitly declared it "safe and
  effective" for its intended uses. This authority renders the FDA the
  gatekeeper of the American pharmaceutical marketplace, and it sustains a
  battery of vast powers. Among these are the power to define medical success
  and shape scientific careers, the power to limit advertising and product
  claims, the power to govern drug manufacturing, the power to enable drug firms
  to generate vast riches and the power to chase those same firms from the
  marketplace, the power to sculpt medical and scientific concepts, and
  ultimately the power to influence the lives and deaths of citizens. Some of
  those citizens may be harmed from hazardous or ineffective therapies that the
  FDA has approved. Other citizens may suffer or die waiting for the agency to
  approve a potentially effective cure. Still others, perhaps most, may easily
  use a drug whose dosage, label, and chemical form have be carefully honed
  through the scrutiny that regulation brings. Whatever the outcome, the FDA has
  shaped the lives of one and all. Among the thousands of people who daily give
  painstaking attention to the agency's every utterance and movement, there is
  considerable disagreement about the Food and Drug Administration &mdash; it is
  venerated in one corner and bemoaned in another; it is targeted for expansion
  by one voice, for evisceration by a second &mdash; but there is no serious doubt
  about its reach or significance.

* 3 A "blockbuster" is drug industry parlance for a highly lucrative drug,
  generally one that generates $1 billion per year or more in revenues. By
  reaping vast profits, a blockbuster drug like Activase can pay off hundreds of
  other, less fortunate wagers that a drug company has made upon promising but
  never-marketed therapies. 

* 3 In the spring of 1987, for many investors, all bets were literally off. The
  panel's decision on Friday, May 29, was a refusal to recommend licensing of
  Activase, and it presaged a more dramatic event; on June 15, the
  Administration would reject the drug for marketing in the United States.
  Genentech's share price quickly plunged by $11.50, to $36.75. In an instant,
  $928 million &mdash; nearly a quarter of the publicly traded value of the
  biotechnology industry's star company &mdash; had vanished.

* 6 The saga of tissue plasminogen activator is significant not merely as
  medical history, but as a canvas in which the politics of pharmaceutical
  regulation and government power are illuminated. A subtle request for
  information had derailed an entire industry's hopes, had erased millions of
  dollars in investment value, and had set in motion a wide-ranging controversy
  to which major national newspapers were devoting prime news and editorial
  pages.

* 6 None of thie import was lost on Genentech's executive at the time, G. Kirfk
  Raab. Raab was hired specifically to smooth the company's journey through the
  regulatory process. Years later, Raab would describe regulatory approval for
  his products as the fundamental challenge facing his company. And he would
  depict the Administration in a particularly vivid metaphor. "I've told a story
  hundreds of times to help people understand the FDA. When I was in Brazil I
  worked on the Amazon River for many months selling Terramycin for Pfizer. I
  hadn't seen my family for eight or nine months. They were flying to Sao
  Paulo, and I was flying down from some little village on the Amazon to Manous
  and then to Sao Paulo. I was a young guy in his twenties. I couldn't wait to
  see the kids. One of them was a year-old baby, the other was three. I missed
  my wife. There was a quonset hut in front of just a little dirt strip with a
  single engine plane to fly me to Manous. I roll up and there is a Brazillian
  soldier standing there. The military revolution had happened literally the
  week before. So this soldier is standing there with this machine gun and he
  said to me: 'You can't come in.' I was speaking pretty good Portuguese by that
  time. I said: 'My god, my plane, my family, I gotta come in!' He said again:
  'You can't come in.' I said: 'I gotta come in!' And he took his machine gun,
  took the safety off, and pointed it at me, and said: 'You can't come in.' And
  I said: 'Oh, now I got it. I can't go in there.' And that's the way I always
  describe the FDA. The FDA is standing there with a machine gun against the
  pharmaceutical industry, so you better be their friend rather than their enemy.
  They are the boss. If you're a pharmaceutical firm, they own you body and
  soul.

* 8 The chronicle of tissue plasminogen activator leaves puzzles that beg for
  explanation and inquiry. How is it that in the United States, long known as
  the land of weak regulation, smaller government, and powerful business, a
  regulatory agency &mdash; any regulatory *any* regulatory agency &mdash; could
  "own you body and soul"? How could a government agency literally reshape the
  content and method of scientific research? How could such an agency exercise
  such vast sway over sectors &mdash; including financial markets and the
  industry of research and development&mdash; that it did not directly govern?
  How in the United States &mdash; a society characterized by the distrust of
  government power, and at no time more starkly than in the 1980s during the 
  presidency of Ronald Reagan &mdash;  could a federal regulatory agency have
  an enviable public reputation that commentators on the left and right duly
  recognized? How could such a reputation endure through criticism by
  scientists, by corporations, by major newspapers? Perhaps more important, how
  could an agency inspire admiration from society while also being feared by
  some of its most powerful members?

### Reputation and the Puzzles of Regulatory Power
* 10 Reputation &mdash; understood as a set of symbolic beliefs about an
  organization, beliefs embedded in multiple audiences &mdash; comprises the
  central response of this study to the puzzle of American regulatory power in
  the global pharmaceutical world. Reputation built on regulatory power in all
  of its facets. And power, once possessed, has been used and managed in ways
  that maintain reputation, and hence power itself. 

* 12 In the 1970s, as public opinion on government capacity soured, the FDA and
  its regulatory work regularly received 70 to 80 percent or more "approval" or
  "confidence" from citizens surveyed; this was double or more the confidence
  ascribed to the federal government, to Congress and various presidents of the
  time in the same surveys. (There's an insanely long footnote on this page that
  details the surprising (to me) survey results).

### Regulatory Power: Directive, Gatekeeping, and Conceptual
* 15 In representing regulatory power in the modern pharmaceutical world, I have
  chosen a threefold conception that harkens to an older tradition of inquiry in
  political science and sociology. The idea is that power exists not only in
  broad formal authority to direct the behavior of others (directive power) but
  also in appearances that are less obvious: the ability to define what sorts of
  problems, debates, and agendas structure human activity (gatekeeping power),
  and the ability to shape the content and structure of human cognition itself
  (conceptual power).

### The Scope and Variance of Regulatory Power: Some Comparative and Historical Riddles
* 19 An intensive study of one government agency may seem of limited value for
  understanding other organizations. Is a focused assay of American
  pharmaceutical regulation over seven decades a "case study" of an organization
  whose patterns illustrate those of other agencies, and if so, why not examine
  these other cases as co-equal recipients of attention? Or is the FDA so unique
  that its analysis speaks with limited range to other settings? I think neither
  of these concerns has warrant. The main problem comes with the term "case
  study" and its all too casual use in academic work. To call something a "case
  study" assumes the goal of extracting universal knowledge about a population
  from a singular entity. A study thus amounts to a "case" only when its
  characteristics are representative of those shared by a larger population of
  research objects; a pharmaceutical regulator in the United States could, under
  this reasoning, represent all other pharmaceutical regulators, all other
  government agencies, or even all other organizations[^1].

  [^1]: Historian of physics Peter Galison has rendered the point
  with hilarity: "Imagine a book entitled *A Case Study in European History:
  France*. 

* 21 The FDA has long employed more scientists and more heavily trained personnel
  than other agencies performing its functions, at times (in the 1970s) more so
  than in all the world's other drug regulators combined. Even as agencies in
  Europe and Asia have advanced in recent years, the United States still houses
  the strongest of global pharmaceutical regulators.

* 22 In the latter half of the twentieth century, an American model for
  pharmaceutical regulation has been perhaps the primary institutional export of
  the Unites States (see table I.1). (This table shows how other nations yoinked
  various US pharma regs like: New Drug Application (NDA), Regulated R&D (Phased
  Studies), Good Manufacturing Practices, and more).

* 25 Some fun puzzles:    
    + Why is pharmaceutical regulation nationalized in the US, while other forms of
   regulation are not? Put equivalently, why is pharmaceutical regulation
   nationalized in the US when other nations, most notably Australia and India,
   have had more decentralized, regional agencies that regulate medicines?
    + Why has the FDA enjoyed greater discretion, policymaking authority, and
   deference from other branches of government in its regulation of drugs,
   compared to its regulation of foods?
    + What accounts for some of the intricate and counterintuitive patterns of
   interplay between firms, scientists, federal regulators, and social groups in
   the US? And how does this most powerful agency exercise its power with such
   limited resources?

### Narrative, Comparison, and Statistics: Empirical Approaches of This Study
* 26 My goals will have been met if the book leaves readers with an appreciation
  for the historical and political complications of US pharmaceutical regulation
  as well as some general lenses through which the seemingly familiar can be
  viewed in a different, potentially surprising, and illuminating way.

* 26 Another reason for preserving and presenting the complexity of US
  pharmaceutical regulation is that most attempts at simplification &mdash; and
  there have been many &mdash; have been misleading. There are dozens of
  writings on US pharmaceutical regulation, and there are many, many more on
  prescription drugs and the American and global pharmaceutical industries.
  Those efforts, while collectively fascinating and occasionally enriching,
  often portray an all too simple landscape. In one common narrative, a
  government agency protects millions of citizens from unscrupulous businesses
  whose lust for profit vastly outweighs their concern for public health or
  consumer safety. In another account, much more popular in recent years, the
  agency has been taken over by the very companies it is supposed to govern,
  converted to a servant of industry. In other stories, an overzealous and
  illegitimate government regulator, subservient either to populist,
  anti-technology consumer advocates or to drug companies themselves, deprives
  patients of medicines that would save their lives, and suffocates the
  innovative technology coming from one of modern capitalism's most dynamic
  sectors. 
        At different moments, each of these narratives tells a partial truth.
  Cautious bureaucrats have bungled. Profit-thirsty firms have recklessly
  produced and poorly tested unsage drugs that have killed and maimed.
  Pharmaceutical firms have indeed exercised more sway over regulatory affairs
  in recent decades. Yet in the aggregate, and over the course of decades of
  American and global history, these stories fundamentally mislead. More
  compelling and accurate truths lie not merely in between these extremes, but
  on other dimensions of experience.

### The Subject, The Theory, and The Approach
* 30 ...in the analysis of reputation and power in regulation, it is not only
  the regulatory official but also her audiences and subjects that merit
  attention (perhaps most of it). 

* 30 Much of the study is focused not on newer forms of medical therapies but
  upon a set of drugs that the FDA has called "new molecular entities." In the
  pharmaceutical world, two categorical distinctions are often employed to break
  apart the continuous and slippery space of drugs. Molecular entities are
  usually distinguished from "biologics." The world of biologics is often
  wrongly conflated with the world of "biotech," when in fact most biotechnology
  drugs are not vaccines or otherwise bioactive. A more pervasive difference is
  between "small" and "large" molecules, such that the larger molecules
  represent proteins and antibodies that are "biologically active," whereas the
  smaller molecules stand in for more traditional drugs without biological
  activity.

* 31 In many cases, depictions of events that I took from interviews as factual
  were, upon further study and reflection, simply one reading (among many) of
  crucial and pivotal events. As I came to do more of them, I found that
  interviews were important less for establishing "what actually happened" and
  more for getting a sense of different lenses through which the same facts, the
  same choices, the same rules, the same organization might be viewed.

## Chapter 1: Regulation and Regulatory Power 
* 33 In ways that are stark and in ways not easily seen, organizational
  reputations animate, empower, and constrain the manifold agencies of
  government. Reputations are composed of symbolic beliefs about an
  organization &mdash; its capacities, intentions, history, mission &mdash; and
  these images are embedded in a network of multiple audiences.

### Regulation and Its Limited Theories
* 35 To take one example, consider the modern automobile. The size, weight, fuel
  efficiency, emissions, and safety characteristics of cars &mdash; and the
  manner in which cars are manufactured &mdash; are all thoroughly and legally
  shaped by national governments, by stats-level agencies and local bureaus, by
  courts, by industry certification programs, and by companies themselves
  through "self-regulation."

* 36 *The Public Interest Theory as a Fictional Straw Man*. ...there is no
  single public interest theory. The term is much more commonly used by capture
  and rent-seeking theorists. It collects under one term an array of views, each
  of which tends to render three claims about the origins and operation of
  regulation.
    + First, regulation should (and generally does) serve the general interest
      of a society, in particular the welfare of consumers. Historically,
      consumer enrichment and protection are the reasons for which regulations
      have been created.
    + Second (which can be read as a variant of the first), regulation serves to
      correct "market failures," such that market failures help to locate and
      explain the rise and incidence of regulation, and such that regulation in
      fact serves to correct or ameliorate these failures.
    + Third, the administrators of a public interest regulation are, and should
      be, characterized by neutral competence in the pursuit of objectives
      specified in law.

* 38 *Recent Normative Accounts of Regulation: Risk and Externalities*. One way
  of viewing government policies or environmental hazards, occupational safety,
  the approval of new medicines and other technologies, and other forms of
  regulation is that they represent public attempts to regulate risk by
  reallocating it across the members of society.

* 40 *Capture and Rent-Seeking Perspectives*. The producer capture argument has
  become perhaps the dominant account of regulatory policy. The theory offers
  both an account of formal regulation &mdash; as in laws and rules &mdash; and
  a portrait of the regulatory agency that administers the formal regulation.
  The legislature rewards the bribes of industry with regulatory protection
  because the form of these bribes &mdash; campaign contributions or votes
  &mdash; assists politicians in their ultimate goal of getting re-elected. The
  agency cozies up to existing firms, particularly the large and stable ones,
  because they provide the reason for its existence. Moreover, the agency and
  the industry ritually exchange personnel and thereby create an unholy
  "revolving door." The agency recruits employees from the industry that it
  regulates. After a period of service at the relevant commission, the officials
  depart the agency and return to industry for lucrative careers there. The
  revolving door hypothesis suggests that industry and regulators are united not
  just by interests but in terms of identity. Regulators and the regulated are
  one and the same people.

* 41 In the past two decades, scholars have refines the capture perspective by
  advancing "interest-group" and "rent-seeking" theories of regulation. These
  views concede that producer interests are not monolithic &mdash; firm
  interests vary by specialization and other things &mdash; and that consumers
  can also organize politically. The fundamental concept in these newer theories
  is "rent-seeking." The pursuits of political favors, of regulatory advantage,
  and of market protection are lumped together under the idea. So heavily and
  vaguely is the term "rent-seeking" thrown around economics, political
  science, law, and sociology that the concept has lot much of its meaning.

* 43 *Organizational Reputation and Regulation* What if the metaphor for
  understanding regulators is neither the automaton nor the kleptocrat? What if,
  instead, it is the imperfect human official motivated either by neutral
  competence nor by monetary enrichment nor by raw empowerment, but by stats,
  esteem, legitimacy, and reputation?

* 44 A facilitating condition for the creation of regulation in modern
  democratic societies is for the attentive public (and legislators in
  particular) to believe that whatever problems exist will be capably addressed
  and solved by a particular agency. In the US and other countries, the
  delegation of tasks in new laws goes overwhelmingly to agencies that already
  exist.

* 45 *Organizational Reputation &mdash; Performative, Moral, Technical, and
  Legal-Procedural Dimensions* The symbols that are the raw material of beliefs
  and reputation have inherent ambiguity, and to a degree, ambiguity coincides
  with robustness of the identity.
    + 1. Organizations are often judged by their performance. Whatever the aim
         of the organization, its *performative reputation* expresses its
         audiences' varying judgments of the quality of the entity's decision
         making and its capacity for effectively achieving its ends and
         announced objectives
    + 2. Agencies also have *moral reputations*. Audiences may ask: does this
         organization have morally and ethically defensible means and ends? Does
         the organization protect the interests of its clients, constituencies,
         and members? Does the organization have a culture of ethical behavior,
         of transparency? Does the organization exhibit compassion for those
         adversely affected by its decisions or those in its environment who are
         less fortunate or more constrained? Is the organization flexible with
         respect to human needs? An organization perceived to be highly
         effective may nonetheless have a problematic moral reputation.
    + 3. *Technical reputation* encompasses variables such as scientific
         accuracy, methodological prowess, and analytic capacity. The
         organization may be efficient and well-meaning, but are its
         representative members "expert" on the questions that confront it? In a
         professional or rational sense, is it "qualifies" for the authority
         (legal and cultural) granted to it?
    + 4. An organization's *legal-procedural reputation* relates to the justness
         of the processes by which its behavior is generated. This is different
         from moral reputation because an organization may have defensible aims
         and ethically appropriate strategies for meeting them, but may not have
         followed commonly recognized norms of deliberation, procedure, or
         decision making. Whatever the decision, audiences (particularly courts
         and some scientific audiences) may ask, did the organization follow
         accepted procedures to come to its decision? Were its procedures
         thorough enough?
* 47 The different facets of organizational reputation overlap and necessarily
  embed some conflict. An organization can be so attentive to procedural
  legitimacy that it sacrifices efficiency or fails to demonstrate compassion
  toward those few individuals whose hopes are dashed by its decision-making
  process. An agency's official leaders can so zealously pursue social justice
  or moral rectitude that they neglect procedural concerns or betray their
  technical reputation.

* 47 *Individual Roots of Organizational Reputation: Image and Esteem* The
  influence of organizational identity upon individual behavior can be
  considered in two ways: the case where the individual is a member of the
  organization, and the case where the individual lies outside the organization.

* 50 At the core of any reputation lies a partial fiction. It is of course
  factually incorrect to speak of "the FDA," "Microsoft, " "General Motors,"
  "the U.S. Army," "the Marines," or "the Catholic Church" as if these were
  perfectly unitary things. Yet citizens do this all the time, and without
  giving conscious thought to it.
  ...A scandal involving the abuse of military prisoners or the slaughter of
  innocents may have been committed by a small handful of soldiers, perhaps
  supported by a local culture of tolerance for such behavior. Yet even the most
  blameless members of the army will feel their organization's association with
  the scandal.

* 51 *Organizational Reputation and Regulatory Politics*. The emergence of
  economic regulation follows a number of different scripts, and it is doubtful
  that any single theory can embed all of them. ...The emergence of new
  technology &mdash; broadcast radio and television, or nuclear power &mdash;
  may be met with the creation of regulatory institutions. A public tragedy such
  as a mass poisoning or even a terrorist attack may be followed by the creation
  of new institutions or the strengthening of old ones.

* 55 *Organizational Reputation and Regulatory Behavior*. A reputation-based
  perspective can alo shed useful light on the behavior of government
  organizations and regulatory bodies once a regulatory policy is established.
  Consider first the individually based motivations of government regulators.
  Organizations and their members in numerous walks of life aim less for profit
  itself, less for power itself, and more for reputation and the associated
  benefits that it brings: prestige, status, and authority.

* 58 To the extent that organizations engage in what sociologist Erving Goffman
  termed "The arts of impression management," then, the calculus is entirely
  different from that of "profit maximization" or "rent--seeking."
  Organizational managers and others committed to the organization's identity
  may be less concerned with "maximizing" a reputation for some trait and more
  concerned with preventing severe damage to a reputation that already exists.

* 58 *Multiple Constituencies as Multiple Overlapping Audiences: Reputation
  versus Pluralism.* The organizations that bear reputations usually have
  multiple audiences. The stories of reputation to which social scientists are
  accustomed often fail to appreciate this multiplicity. In economics and
  political science, for instance, scholars have constructed models of
  reputation in game theory that are premised upon the metaphor of a
  "chain-store" game. A chain of stores may, in a particular locality, face a
  threat from a competitor. In dealing with this threat, the chain store must
  understand that its actions in this local situation will create a reputation
  for its likely behavior in similar situations in the future. Other potential
  competitors in other localities will consider this reputation when
  deciding whether or not to compete in those places. Hence, and important
  equilibrium of these games is for the chain store to "snuff out" the first
  appearance of a competitor, thereby projecting a reputation for vigilance or
  toughness, and hence scaring off competition in other locales.

* 60 Scholars of national bureaucracy in the US have long recognized that agency
  personnel experience great and direct disutility from being called to "the
  Hill" to testify, discomfort having little to do with congressional oversight
  or the threat of congressional action such as budget cuts after the hearing.
  For many agencies, a legislative setting is the forum where their decisions
  are most likely to be publicly revealed, discussed, and criticized, and one of
  the few fora in which these criticisms will be delivered face-to-face.

* 61 *Faces of Regulatory Power and Their Interdependence.* An understanding of
  reputation and its meanings among different audiences also permits new windows
  into regulatory power. In the United States and other countries, observers
  have been as likely to stress the weaknesses of regulatory agencies as they
  have been to emphasize the power of these organizations.

* 62 *The Distinctiveness of Regulatory Power.* Much of economic regulation
  involves a subject acting upon an object, the governance of a "regulated
  entity" by the empowered "regulator." Accordingly, and agent of government
  exercises regulatory power when it induces the regulated entity to begave in a
  manner that it would not have behaved, absent the presence or behavior of the
  regulator. Under a pattern of regulatory power, put differently, a regulated
  entity takes action or inaction that would not have occurred if the regulator
  were not present or had behaved differently.

* 63 In its most raw form, a regulator can issue an order for a private actor to
  "cease and desist" from production, distribution, or marketing of a particular
  good. The regulator can often seize supplies of the good in question or shut
  down the operations of its producer or marketer.

* 63 A second, gatekeeping facet of regulatory power emerges in the less
  visible decisions of economic producers or political combatants not to bring
  an idea or issue into the arena of political economy. A group of investors may
  decide to pull their capital from a new communications company, fearful that
  the firm will be too heavily regulated. Or a bank decides not to fund a new
  construction project out of belief that the developer's application for a new
  construction permit will be denied or delayed.

* 64 A third, conceptual facet of regulatory power consists in the ability
  (often unconsciously exercised) of the governing organization to shape
  fundamental patterns of thought, communication, and learning by its formal and
  informal definition of concepts, vocabularies, measurements, and standards.

* 66 *Reputation as Asset: Protection and Maintenance*. Identity, and especially
  its reputational facet, has an asset value. Once crystallized, and once
  recognized, officials with authority in an organization may take measured
  steps to protect, maintain, and enhance it.

* 67 *Risk Aversion and Irreversibility of Public Decisions.* The decisions that
  face many regulators are decisions of timing accompanied by learning. An
  enforcement agency's attorneys must sift through evidence and decide whether
  to pursue a civil or criminal case against a private entity... A central
  prediction of a reputation-based account is that, on the whole, these sorts of
  decisions will have an irreversibility attached to them. Once the decision is
  taken &mdash; once the case is litigated and a party is sued, once a wetland
  or a grazing permit is granted, once a product is approved for marketing
  &mdash; it is difficult for the regulator to go back on the decision without
  serious consequences for the agency's reputation... This looks like aversion
  to risk, and in part it is. But it is something more. It is aversion to
  reputational damage.

* 68 *Governance through Networks*. Members of a firm, a professional group, a
  consumer lobby, and other organizations may be invited to participate in the
  decisions of the agency, or in councils of advice to the agency.

* 68 *Revisitation Constraints*. The near-irreversibility of publlic decisions
  by reputation-conscious regulators has implications for their behavior after
  these choices are made. Once a decision has been rendered &mdash; having taken
  longer and having been characterized by more caution due to irreversibility
  concerns &mdash; the regulator will not wish to revisit it. More properly,
  some actors who were responsible for the decision will not wish to reopen the
  case.

* 69 *Different Faces for Different Audiences*. An organization's legitimacy may
  rest upon its "good cop" image, but the sound functioning of its policing
  activity may frequently require projection of a "bad cop" image to some
  audiences (regulated firms and industries, for example).

* 69 *Ambiguity*. It is important to emphasize that ambiguity usually exists for
  many reasons, and that even strategic regulatory ambiguity does not imply any
  sort of conspiracy. It is always difficult to define an organization's
  identity and to pin it down.

* 69 *Reputation as a Font of Regulatory Power*. Political organizations often
  pursue both love and fear at the same time, and the resulting tension requires
  a delicate pattern of equipoise... A reputation-bbased account is not a
  panacea for all that ails the study of regulation. Reputation is not a
  theoretical perspective that characterizes all forms of regulation, or even
  all forms of regulator. Still it does govern some forms, perhaps many forms,
  and a complicated politics of reputation and organizational image has been a
  central force in the evolution of pharmaceutical regulation in the US and
  other countries and continents.



# PART ONE: ORGANIZATIONAL EMPOWERMENT AND CHALLENGE

## Chapter 2: Reputation and Gatekeeping Authority: The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and Its Aftermath

* 73 Reputation and Power in American pharmaceutical regulation evolved jointly
  in an extended moment of image making and lawmaking. These crucial steps
  toward the interlacing of reputation and power came in the middle of the New
  Deal, with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, its subsequent
  enforcement by the FDA, and the Supreme Court's decision in *United States v.
  Dotterweich* (1943) [^2].

[^2]: Carpenter continually refers to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as
    "the Act of 1938" or "the 1938 Act."

* 73 By all accounts, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 issued
  from crisis... As their bill laye stalled in Congress in the fall of 1937, a
  new anti-infective drug, "Dr. Massengill's Elixer Sulfanilamide," caused 107
  deaths and stoked national fears and controversy. USDA officials quickly
  tracked down supplies of the drug and removed it from market circulation, from
  pharmacy shelves, and home medicine cabinets.

* 75 *Early Drug Regulation, Proprietary Medicines, and the "Right of
  Self-Medication"* ...it was not until the Biologics Act of 1902 and the Pure
  Food and Drugs Act of 1906 that direct and authoritative federal involvement
  in drug regulation was sanctioned. The first of these acts quietly established
  a precedent for minimal licensing power in the field of vaccines. The second
  established federal penalties for adulterating or misbranding medicines and
  strengthened a rapidly growing federal agency &mdash; the US Department of
  Agriculture (USDA) &mdash; whose capacity for policy innovation in the
  Progressive Era spawned many other vital reforms.

* 76 The other agent of American drug regulation at this time was a
  nongovernmental actor: the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American
  Medical Association, established in 1905. The Council included
  pharmacologists, chemists, and physicians in its membership, and it published
  standards for drug quality. In 1930, it created a voluntary "Seal of
  Acceptance" program to evaluate safety and efficacy. When the Council deemed a
  drug unsafe, it could act to prevent the drug's advertisement in the *Journal
  of the American Medical Association* (JAMA). In critical ways, FDA officials
  and their advisers would incorporate and build upon the Council's thinking.

* 78 The set of drugs marketed as patent medicines varied widely in their
  composition and therapeutic claims. Anti-impotence medications and sexual
  stimulation drugs with names such as "Persenico" and "Revivio" were very
  common... Perhaps worse, many patent medicines were associated with high
  toxicity and other safety hazards. Most "soothing tonics" for babies and
  children were laced with alcohol, opium or some combination of the two.
  "Gouraud's Oriental Face Cream" led to "genuine facial beauty," but government
  investigators later learned that it did so by imparting significant mercury to
  its consumers, thereby inducing skin discoloration.

* 80 The proprietary medicine industry entered the twentieth century almost
  completely unregulated. The signal change in Progressive-Era regulation of
  drugs came in 1906, when Dr. Harvey Wiley of the USDA's Bureau of Chemistry
  successfully completed a twenty-year campaign to pass a federal food and drug
  regulation bill. The 1906 law gave USDA power to seize articles of manufacture
  deemed "fraudulent" or falsely advertised, and prodigious cooperation between
  Wiley and officials at the Post Office Department was successful in the
  prosecuting hundreds of cases in the Progressive period. Yet such cases were
  always prosecuted after the harm had occurred, and the associated penalties
  were minimal.

* 80 *The Emergence of New Regulatory Alternatives: Bureaucratic Agenda-Setting and
  the Power of Organized Women* Calls for a revision of the 1906 Pure Food and
  Drugs Act were largely unrelated to changes in the proprietary medicine
  industry or to consumer tragedies of the 1920s and early 1930s. Instead, two
  forces &mdash; the FDA (backed by Roosevelt administration officials in the
  Department of Agriculture) and organized women's groups &mdash; exercised
  strong leverage in pressing for changes to the 1906 law.

* 81 S.1944 required disclosure of ingredients on labels, removed the 1906 Act's
  requirement that the FDA had to prove intent to defraud in order to seize
  shipments of a good, gave the FDA power to seize multiple shipments of
  "misbranded" goods, and rendered advertisers and manufacturers alike legally
  liable for fraudulent claims. The bill also gave to the FDA power over
  pharmaceutical advertising. S.2800 and S.5 relaxed many of these provisions,
  in particular by introducing judicial constraints on seizures and by relaxing
  the formula disclosure provisions of earlier bills.

* 85 *The Sulfanilamide Episode of 1937* FDA officials therefore suspected that
  the problem lay not in the sulfanilamide itself but rather in the elixir
  solution in which it was suspended for pharmacological delivery. Dr.
  Massengill's solvent, as it turned out, was diethylene glycol, which is
  similar to an essential ingredient in antifreeze and is highly toxic even in
  small doses. 
  ... Yet the concentration of deaths (and shipments) suggests something about
  the mechanisms by which the drug was propagated through a large population of
  consumers. The prescription and consumption of elixir sulfanilamide was
  probably dependent upon local referral networks and the idiosyncratic
  practices of individual physicians.

* 89 *Sulfanilamide from Episode to Tragedy: The FDA and the National Media*
  Three days after the initial Tulsa inquiry at the AMA, the first word of
  elixir sulfanilamide deaths reached the FDA on October 14, 1937. On October
  16, an FDA investigator telegraphed headquarters with news that nine persons
  in the Tulsa area had died there from taking the elixir. 
  ... There was a degree of mutual dependence in this reporting. The
  Administration relied upon AMA reports and its own investigators; the AMA
  relied upon FDA reports and its own information from networks of physicians.

* 90 Venereal Disease 'Cure' Kills 8 of 10 Patients in Oklahoma *Sulfanilamide,
  Hailed as Remedy, Used in Fatal Preparation; Doctors Blame Other Drug; Firm
  seeks to Recover 375 Cases on Market* As the title of the *Post* story suggests,
  the very initial accounts of sulfanilamide deaths never mentioned the FDA. The
  American Medical Association had broken the story, and it was the manufacturer
  Massengill and not the FDA to which was attributed the attempt to remove
  Elixir Sulfanilamide from the Market. 

* 91 By the end of the week (Saturday, October 23), and certainly by the end of
  October 1937, the primary source of information on the sulfanilamide episode
  had become Campbell and the FDA.

* 92 Technically nothing in the elixir sulfanilamide disaster implied that the
  Massengill Company had broken a single law. There was little basis in federal
  stature for prosecuting Bristol. The only charge against Massengill that stuck
  was an arcane mislabeling charge, namely that "elixir" implied alcoholic
  content yet "Elixir Sulfanilamide" contained no alcohol.

* 95 *Walter Campbell and the Wallace Report.* From the very earliest stages of
  the sulfanilamide episode, Walter Campbell and his FDA associates saw an
  opportunity to add a pre-market licensing provision to the nation's food and
  drug statute.

* 96 Wallace and his FDA colleagues distilled one overwhelming lesson from the
  tragedy: the absolute necessity of pre-market review of drugs to assess their
  safety profile: ... A few simple and inexpensive tests on experimental animals
  would have quickly demonstrated the toxic properties of both diethylene glycol
  and the "elixir."

* 97 The most widely known story was prompted by a letter from Mrs. Maise
  Nideffer of Tulsa &mdash; whose six-year-old daughter Joan died from taking
  the drug &mdash; to President Roosevelt. Nidiffer wrote of her daughter's
  harrowing death, "her little body tossing to & fro... & that little voice
  screaming with pain and it seems as tho it drive me insane [sic]." She pleaded
  with the president to "take steps to prevent such sales of drugs that will take
  little lives & leave such suffering behind and such a bleak outlook on the
  future as I have tonight." Along with the letter, she enclosed a photograph of
  her smiling but now deceased child, a print that made its way into several
  newspaper reports and into the USDA report on the tragedy.

* 102 *The Sulfanilamide Tragedy and the Passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
  Act of 1938* ...On December 1, 1937, Copeland introduced a new measure to
  replace S.5. Copeland's S.3073 had many of the provisions of S.5, but added
  the pre-market review provision in a new "Section 505," which remains today
  the basis for FDA review of new drugs. The bill required manufacturers to
  supply the USDA with records of their clinical and nonclinical experiments, a
  list of the drug's ingredients, a plan for manufacturing practices, and
  examples of labels. The Secretary of Agriculture would then certify the drug
  for sale or give a reason why the drug was refused marketability.

* 105 For purposes of legislative history, the essential puzzle is this: Why did
  Congress move from unanimous Senate support of a weaker bill in the first
  session of the 75th Congress( May to August 1937) to a generally unanimous
  approval of a stronger bill in the second session of the 75th Congress (April
  and June 1938)? ...What changed was not voting patterns but the *content* of
  the proposed legislation. What is needed to explain the 1938 legislation and
  its difference from 1937 bills, then, is not voting analysis but narrative.

* 108 Hard-core opponents of FDA authority continued to speak out against the
  Copeland legislation, implying that the unanimity observed in the vote was not
  indicative of a full embrace of the 1938 Act by all those who voted for it.
  Although the final House margin of passage was "overwhelming" )nut also
  unreported), FDA opponents there continued a vigorous defense of the right of
  self-medication and loudly voiced their worries about the continued accretion
  of bureaucratic power to federal agencies.

* 109 *Lessons of the Policy Tragedy of Elixir Sulfaniamide* New regulations
  often follow tragedies, but not reflexively so. ...the Administration
  possessed a near monopoly on information relating to sulfanilamide and the
  deaths resulting from it, the conversion of sulfanilamide from episode to
  tragedy was in large measure the effective work of a single organization.
  ...Many features of the regulation had been proposed and refined before the
  deaths occurred. It was because of this context, not in spite of it, that the
  1938 law passed.

* 110 Much of the costly work of building coalitions behind legislation had
  already been accomplished. Had the sulfanilamide tragedy occurred at another
  time, when FDA regulation as the dominant alternative to the status quo was
  not advanced by bureaucratic leaders, the Act either would not have passed or
  would have taken a much different form. In this respect, it is possible to
  confidently reject the counterfactual that, had the sulfanilamide tragedy not
  occurred, regulatory reform in food and drugs would not have been on the
  agenda in the 75th Congress. ...What the sulfanilamide tragedy did, once
  distilled by USDA-FDA rhetoric, was to change the specific legislative agenda
  from regulation without licensure to regulation with licensure.

* 110 *Framing: The Inversion of Victimhood, the Admixture of Race and
  Innocence*. ...Whereas the early medical reports described a drug popular
  among mature men, many of them black, many of whom were seeking a quick and
  private treatment for syphilis, the Administration had, by the late autumn of
  1937, morphed the exemplar of a sulfanilamide victim, and the visible
  casualty of policy failure, into the darling face of Joan Nidiffer. The
  victimhood of American policy failure had been inverted, from black, make, and
  possibly sexually licentious, to white, virginal, and deserving.

* 112 The endeavors of Walter Campbell, Royal Copeland, and Henry Wallace are
  forgotten now. Yet they shaped the American and global history of medicine and
  pharmaceutical development for decades in ways that have yet to be
  appreciated, and perhaps never will. Their actions amount to a form of
  political innovation, a feat shared in this case between a career bureaucrat
  (Campbell), and administrator emerging as a national politician (Wallace), and
  a career legislator (Copeland). The saga of American pharmaceutical regulation
  and its origins demonstrates that political innovation and entrepreneurship,
  in its most powerful and enduring moment, consists in symbolic politics
  &mdash; in the interpretation, framing, and public distillation of observable
  history.

* 112 *The Construction of Processes and Standards*. The 1938 statute compelled
  FDA administrators and scientists to construct from scratch an entirely new
  system of processing and evaluation. An applied chemistry bureau now had to
  solve a problem that was jointly regulatory and administrative &mdash; the
  review of hundreds of requests to market a novel legal and commercial entity
  known as a "new drug." ...the first novel therapeutic compound submitted unter
  the law &mdash; sulfapyridine &mdash; expressed important patterns of
  evaluation that would be applied to later drugs. Merck's sulfapyridine &mdash;
  submitted to the FDA in October 1938 &mdash; was the latest in the celebrated
  class of sulfa drugs that had revolutionized anti-infective therapy in the
  late 1930s.

* 113 From the very first moments of sulfapyridine's review, and hence from the
  very first moments of the 1938 Act's application, medical officers considered
  questions of "therapeutic value" in new drug review. ...By February 1939, when
  they concluded that their existing data were insufficient for a decision, they
  interviewed another forty-five clinicians about the drug. Pressures for
  sulfapyridine's release began to grow, and on February 12, 1939, Theodore
  Klumpp issued a letter indicating the agency would not withhold the drug's
  approval.

* 114 Klumpp and Durrett actually knew early on in the sulfapyridine review that
  the drug would eventually be approved; the question was not whether to
  approve, but when, and under what conditions as expressed in the drug's
  labeling. Much of the early proactive of drug review became an exercise in
  regulating the label. The Administration was less likely to reject new drug
  applications themselves than to disallow labeling claims and to delay the
  clearance of the drug until labeling claims could be settled. ...What changed
  for firms like Merck was less the fact of pharmacology than its intensity; the
  rigor and thoroughness of the work expected had increased so much as to upset
  established patterns of laboratory work and division of scientific labor.
  ...from 1938 to 1939 alone, Merck's experimental work increased 62 percent...

* 116 *Judicial Legitimation of Industry Fear: The Dotterweich Decision of 1943*
  The mid-century legal challenge to American pharmaceutical regulation came
  when FDA investigators charged the chief executive of the Buffalo Pharmacal
  Company with violation of the 1938 Act's Section 301(a), which prohibits the
  "introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any
  drug that is adulterated or misbranded."

* 117 With the *Dotterweich* decision, pharmaceutical and chemical executives
  could now be called to account for introducing a misbranded drug into
  interstate commerce. Criminal responsibility for regulatory violations was
  placed upon those individuals with the greatest degree of authoritative power
  in the modern corporation. The Administration now had legal authority to place
  responsibility for regulatory violations at the highest level of the firm.
  ...Reputation and power in the sulfanilamide episode were general and public.
  In the sulfapyridine review and later moments of administrative practice, and
  the *Dotterweich* decision, the audiences, the reputation, and the regulatory
  force of the Administration were particular and targeted, but no less vast.



## Chapter 3: The Ambiguous Emergence of American Pharmaceutical Regulation, 1944-1961

* 118 The bureaucratic regulation of pharmaceuticals arrived not starkly in new
  laws, nor in scientific and medical upheavals, but continuously, haltingly,
  and ambiguously in regulatory practice. It came in administrative conflict and
  the symbolic lessons that citizens, journalists, scientists, company
  officials, and federal policymakers drew from those struggles. ... There was
  no designer, no founding moment. Instead , a slow, publicly imperceptible
  clash of administrative practices, scientific debates, business strategies,
  and individual agendas issued in a set of alternative understandings of
  regulation, industry, and science.

* 119 Doctor Frances Oldham Kelsey arrived to the FDA and began processing
  Richardson-Merrell's new drug application for Kevadon (thalidomide), a
  sedative already widely used in Europe. Kelsey found flaws in the application
  and delayed Kevadon's introduction into the United States. Only two years
  later would the wisdom of her judgment be so horrifically confirmed, as
  thousands of infants were born limbless, earless, and dead in Europe and
  Australia from complications resulting from thalidomide use. Thalidomide was
  pulled from the worldwide market, and Kelsey was soon celebrated as a national
  heroine in the United States.

* 120 The arrival of procedural drug regulation happened not merely in science,
  not merely in business, and not merely within the confines of an agency. It
  happened at the interstices of state, medicine, and market. In a set of
  far-reaching procedural and behavioral changes surrounding federal drug
  evaluation, there three realms overlapped and hosted a subtle but vast and
  durable shift in American pharmaceutical policy.

    * First, FDA officials developed a set of uncoordinated practices and
      rationales for efficacy regulation and pharmacological evaluation in the
      late 1940s and early 1950s, at least eight years before Frances Kelsey
      arrives to the agency. 

    * Second, the fundamental change was not statutory revision, but a joint
      shift in perception and in practice. Once set of changes saw the
      congealing of beliefs among professions and disciplines, U.S. and European
      companies, politicians and a media-saturated public.
      * Federal officials, company scientists, and clinical investigators at
        hospitals and universities began to apply novel standards of assessment
        to all new drugs: protocols for a sequence of experiments, more exacting
        and lengthy toxicology studies, multiple species in animal trials,
        randomization of human subjects, placebo arms, exact testing for
        dose-response relationships, stability and physiological availability
        of the rug in the bloodstream, and more.
      * Firms varied appreciably in the speed and skill with which they adapted.
        Some withered, others prospered, and some converted their skill in
        navigating the regulatory maze into the primary basis of their corporate
        value.
    * Third, the symbolic and practical emergence of the modern FDA was
      equivalent, in large part, to the departure of other organizations from
      important policy niches in early Cold War U.S. politics. Among these, chief
      was the waning of the American Medical Association and its role in
      evaluating drugs. As the political and scientific niche of "drug
      evaluation" evolved, the FDA's Bureau of Medicine came to possess a
      procedural monopoly on the activity. So too, the federal regulation of
      labeling, promotion, dispensing, and prescription patterns and
      distribution networks incurred deeply into the turf of organized
      pharmacists, particularly the American Pharmaceutical Association.

* 124 *The Severity of Procedural Scrutiny: Organizational Change and
  Bureaucratic Learning* In the wake of the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, a
  collision of forces brought pharmaceutical companies, academic researchers,
  and regulators into a new world. A new generation of chemical therapeutics was
  changing the practice of medicine, the conduct of public health, and the
  nature of pharmaceutical development and production. At the same time,
  academic medicine was being influenced by the development of rational
  therapeutics and clinical pharmacology, both emphasizing the prospective,
  statistical, and experimental evaluation and utilization of medicines and
  alternative treatments.
  * The vibrancy of regulatory politics during the 1950s belies the "dark
    decade" image that Philip Hilts, Morton Mintz, and others have given to the
    time. Some of the most familiar players in that drama, most ntably FDA
    Commissioner George Larrick, occupied a set of much more complicated
    positions and carried and vocalized a more diverse range of views than the
    recent chroniclers have described.
    * George Larrick was an organization man caught between these two worlds.
      The older world of regulation by inspection and enforcement &mdash; in
      which Larrick had been trained, and in which the public enemies of note
      were the "cancer quack" and the drug adulterer *mdash; was giving way to a
      new reality of molecular pharmaceutical development, an art that even the
      wealthiest and most equipped of companies could not master.

* 125 *FDA Recruitment and the Regime of Pharmacology.* The post-War vision of
  drug regulation emerged from a congeries of factories, not least administrative
  experience, the chemotherapeutic revolution in pharmaceuticals and the rise of
  molecular drugs for chronic conditions, and the increasing prominence of
  toxicology and clinical pharmacology at university medical faculties and in
  the FDA itself.
  * It stemmed fom the advocacy of a coterie of new physician-bureaucrats,
    including Ralph G. Smith, Ralph Weilerstein, Albert "Jerry" Holland, Barbara
    Moulton, Irvin Kerlan, Gordon and others. 
    * Smith was head of the New Drug Branch and responsible for policy
      development; he was the agency's pioneer in articulating and orchestrating
      the use of efficacy considerations into new drug review. Smith rendered
      explicit and conscious less formal patterns of efficacy evaluation
      that prevailed from 1938 through the 1940s. 
    * Weilerstein was a San Franscisco-based inspector who spoke with ever
      greater force during the 1950s and eventually became Associate Medical
      Director (in 1957) and then Medical Director of the FDA (in 1961) before
      returning to the West Coast. 
    * Holland was FDA Medical Director in the mid-1950s, the agency's most
      talented spokesman, and with Ralph Smith, a major force in recruiting
      pharmacological and medical talent to the agency.
    * Moulton was among the most radical o fthe new medical officers in
      Washington, and responsible for the agency's aggressive posture in
      critical new drug applications such as Altafur. 
    * Kerlan headed the BOM's Research and Reference Branch and is perhaps the
      individual most responsible for the FDA's contemporary adverse events
      reporting system.
    * The other voice of the procedural regime in the 1950s FDA was Albert
      "Jerry" Holland, Jr. formerly of the New York University College of
      Medicine and Armour Laboratories, where he had been medical director.
      Holland had also spent pivotal years at the Atomic Energy Commission,
      where he had forged ties with Allan Gregg. Following Erwin Nelson's tenure
      as medical director of the FDA, Holland was appointed to the post in March
      1954.
  * 126 At the head of these efforts was Arnold J. Lehman, M.D., director of the
    Division from 1946 on. ... Then in 1955 and 1958, the Pharmacology Division
    issued a new manual &mdash; *Appraisal of Safety of Chemicals in Foods,
    Drugs and Cosmetics* &mdash; that combined and standardized methods for the
    different targets of regulation under the 1938 Act. Then in 1955 and 1958,
    the Pharmacology Division issued a new manual--*Appraisal of Safety of
    Chemicals in Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics*--that combined and standardized
    methods for the different targets of regulation under the 1938 Act.
    * 129 Studies of chronic toxicity increasingly pointed to an important but
      little recognized connection between food additives and drugs. The drugs
      for chronic conditions being developed in the 1950s would, like synthetic
          food additives, expose humans to potentially toxic substances over
          many years through weekly or daily consumption. Hence, regulatory
          questions of "safety" shifted from short-term to long-term use. In a
          January 1950 speech FDA Medical Director Erwin Nelson argued that
          "each [new drug] application should carry a sound pharmacological and
          tocicological study."
    * 133 The late 1940s and 1950s witnessed the slow, piecemeal, and only
      half-intentional establishment of networks of information exchange,
      referral and consultation amaong FDA officials and pharmacology faculties
      at university medical centers... It appears that Geiling had the most
      pronounced effect upon hiring at the FDA. Geiling was arguably the most
      prominent student of John Jacob Abel, and was a leader in pharmacology and
      toxicology.
    * 135 The shift in FDA recruitmment was accompanied by a transformation in
      the form and practice or pharmacoloty at numerous university medical
      shchools. One of the cleanest markers for this transformation was the 1955
      publication of Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman's *The Pharmacological
      Basis of Therapeutics; A Textbook of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and
      Therapeutics for Physicians and Medical Students.
    * 135 Along with a focus on new types of drugs, clinical pharmacology
      brought to its classical forebear an emphasis on prospective study
      designs, a study protocol, and centralized administration of experimental
      assignment.
    * 136 The emergence of randomized controlled trials as a science began in
      England, with the trial of streptomycin by the United Kingdom's Medical
      Research COuncil as a standard-setting reference point. In the United
      States, where the term "clinical pharmacology' was first used, much of the
      early funding for clinical pharmacology units at medical schools came from
      grants from the National Instutues of Health, and much additional funding
      came from the pharmaceutical industry itself.
    * 140 In the 1940s, pharmacology chief Lehman recalled, " new-drug
      applications were made effective without requiring animal work and no
      regular review of applications was made by the Division of Pharmacology."
    * 142 If FDA officers could write lucidly about the reality of the new
      pharmacology, they were less clear about its implications. Neither a
      change in statute nor a change in political direction, but the evolving
      practice of pharmaceutical evaluation now demanded that new drug
      applications pass a higher hurdle before market entry. "The requirements
      for acceptance of NDA's have increased," Robert Roe wrote in 1958, "This
          change has to some extent been subtle and has occurred gradually as
          with experience it has been found desirable to ask for more
          information and additional tests." The typical review "might consume
          many days of literature research and review by pharmacologists,
          microbiologists, nutritionists, and chemists, as well as other members
          of the technical staff."
    * 145 By the late 1950s, it was assumed among leading drug firms and elite
      medical professionals that drug testing would involve not just any
      physician, not just any scientist, but a pharmacologist. Leading drug
      firms such as Lilly, Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Schering, and Hoffmann-La Roche
      were actively employing pharmacologists in the research and development
      divisions and aggressively expanding their chemical and pharmacological
      laboratories.
    * 146 *Organizational Learning through Adversity*. The emerging regime of
      procedural pharmacology in regulation was accompanied by some difficult
      lessons from the late 1940s and early 1950s... Along with the arrival to
      power of a new cohort of regulators, a series of memorable, sometimes
      jarring interactions between the FDA and drug companies occurred. These
      episodes upset older categories and shook loose a set of cozy assumptions
      and relationships... Established and reasonably trusted firms presented
      just as much a problem as did fly-by-night operations. NDAs were being
      abused and the investigational phase of drug development was being
      commercially hijacked.
    * 157 In their essence, the regulations of 1955 and 1956 rewrote fundamental
      portions of U.S. pharmaceutical regulation. Whereas the new drug section
      of the 1938 Act--section 505(b)-- had required a demonstration that drugs
      would be "safe for use," FDA rules now provided for summary rejection as
      "incomplete" any new drug application that did not contain detailed,
      individualized data and a report on "therapeutic results observed."
    * 179 Until 1954, the first quartile had never exceeded two months, but from
      1955 to 1960 (all years before the thalidomide episode) it rose steaduly
      to over four months, Put differently, as of 1960, fully three-quarters of
      all drugs could be expected to last more than four months in the FDA's new
      drug review process.
