### Introduction
* x "The only true voyage would be not to travel through a hundred different
    lands with the same pair of eyes, but to see the same land through a hundred
    different pairs of eyes."
* xi As often happens at forks in the path - college graduation, quarter-life
    crisis, midlife crisis, kids leaving home, retirement - questions started to
    bubble to the surface.
    + *Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want?*
    + *How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning?*
    + *How coule I be kinder to myself?*
    + *How could I better say no to the noise to better say yes to the
        adventures I craved?*
    + *How coule I best reassess my life, my priorities, my view of the world,
        my place in the world, and my trajextory through the world?*
* xi *What would it look like if it were easy?*
* xii *What if I assembled a tribe of mentors to help me?*
    + More specifically, what if I asked 100+ brilliant people the very
        questions I want to answer for myself? Or somehow got them to guide me
        in the right direction?
* xiii Nearly all of the people I reached out to are busy beyond belief, and I
    expected I would het short, rushed responses from a few of them at best.
    What I got back instead were some of the most thoughtful answers I'd ever
    received, whether on paper, in person, or otherwise. In the end, there were
    more than 100 respondents.
* xiii The older I get, the more time I spend - as a percentage of each day - on
    crafting better questions. In my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x
    to 100x, and from 100x to 1000x returns in various areas has been a product
    of better questions.
* xiv Milan Kundera has said that "The stupidity of people comes from having an
    answer for everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question
    for everything." Substitute "master learner" for "novel," and you have my
    philosophy of life. Often, all that stands between you and what you want is
    a better set of questions.
* xiv First, let us take a quick pass of the 11 questions. Some of them might
    seem trite or useless at first glance.... But lo! Things are not always what
    they appear.
    + 1 What is the book (or books) you've given most as a gift, and why? Or
        what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?
    + 2 What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in
        the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics
        like brand and model, where you found it, etc.
    + 3 How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do
        you have a "favorite failure" of yours?
    + 4 If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it -
        metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions -
        what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If
        helpful, it can be someone else's quote: Are there any wuotes you think
        of often or live your life by?)
    + 5 What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you've ever made?
        (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)
    + 6 What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?
    + 7 In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most
        improved your life?
    + 8 What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to
        enter the "real world"? What advice should they ignore?
    + 9 What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of
        expertise?
    + 10 In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to
        (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or
        approaches helped? Any other tips?
    + 11 When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focues
        temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask
        yourself?)
* xvi Why these questions are based:
    + 1 "What's your favorite book?" seems like a good question. So innocent, so
        simple. In practice, it's terrible. "Most gifted" is lower risk, an
        easier search query (easier to recall), and implies benefits for a
        broader spectrum of people, which the idiosyncratic "favorite" does not.
    + 2 This might seem like a throwaway, but it isn't. It provides an easy
        entry point for busy interviewees while providing readers with something
        immediately actionable.
    + 3 The superheroes you have in your mind are nearly all walking flaws
        who've maximized one or two strengths.
    + 4 For would-be interviewers, though, the "If helpful..." portion is often
        critical for getting good answers.
    + 5 In a live interview, it buts them time to think, and in text, it gives
        them a template.
    + 6 Answers prove a number of helpful things: 1) Everyone is crazy, so
        you're not alone. 2) If you want more OCD-like behaviors, my
        interviewees are happy to help, and 3) Corollary to #1: "normal" people
        are just crazy people you don't know well enough.
    + 7 This is short, effective, and not particularly nuanced.
    + 8 Since what we *don't* do determines what we *can* do, I like asking
        about not-to-do lists.
    + 9 Many problems of "focusing" are best solved by defining what to ignore.
    + 10 Saying yes is easy. Saying no is hard.
    + 11 The more surprising part of all of this is... *Tribe of Mentors*
        changes with you. As time passes and life unfolds, things you initially
        swatted away like a distraction can reveal depth and become unimaginably
        important.
* xx The entire spectrum of humnan emotion and ezperience can be found in this
    book, from hilarious to heart-wrenching, from failure to success, and from
    life to death. May you welcome it all.
* xx This book is not intended to be a passive experience. It's intended to be a
    call to action. You are the author of your own life, and it's never too late
    to replace the stories you tell yourself and the world. It's never too late
    to begin a new chapter, add a surprise twist, or change genres entirely.
* xxi Remember those rejection letters I mentioned receiving for this bool? Some
  of the polite declines were so good that I included them! There are three "How
  to Say No" interludes that feature actual emails.

### Samin Nosrat 
* 1 Samin Nosrat is a writer, teacher, and chef. Called "a go-to resource for
  matching the correct techniques with the best ingredients" by *The New York
  Times*, and "the next Julia Child" by NPR's *All Things Considered*,  
* 1 Paul Stamets' Host Defense MyCommunity mushroom complex is the most 
  incredible immunity supplement I have ever taken (and I have taken a lot of 
  them!). No matter how much I travel, how many hands I shake, or how exhausted 
  I am, I don't get sick as long as I take the supplement diligently.
* 2 I've learned to envision the ideal end to any project before I begin it 
  now; even the best gigs don't last forever. Nor should they.
* 3 Ten years ago, while running a restaurant, I made the time to audit a class
  at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkely with Michael Pollan... I
  got to know Michael, who encouraged me to write. He also hired me to teach him
  how to cook, and over the course of those lessons he encouraged me to
  formalize my unique cooking philosophy into a proper curriculum, go out into
  the world and teach it, and turn it into a book.
* 4 Other times, I decide to go to the farmers market to look at, touch, smell,
  and taste the produce and let my senses guide me in the decision of what to
  cook for dinner.

### Steven Pressfield
* 5 He is the best-selling author of *The Legend of Bagger Vance, Gates of Fire,
  The Afghan Campaign,* and *The Lion's Gate,* as well as the cult classics on
  creativity, *The War of Art, Turning Pro,* and *Do the Work.*
* 6 ...the best things that ever happened to me came during the times when the
  shit hit the fan and I had nothing and nobody to help me.Who are you really?
  What do you *really* want? Get out there and fail and find out.
* 7 Thucydides, like all the Greeks of his era, was unencumbered by Christian
  theology, or Marxist dogma, or Freudian psychology, or any of the other "isms"
  that attempt to convince us that man is basically good, or perhaps
  perfectible.
* 9 Bad advice is everywhere. Build a following. Establish a platform. Learn how
  to scam the system. In other words, do all the surface stuff and none of the
  real work it takes to actually produce something of value. The disease of out
  times is that we live on the surface... Real work and real satisfaction come
  from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going *deep* into
  something - the book you're writing, the album, the movie - and staying there
  for a long, long time.

### Susan Cain
* 10 Susan Cain is the co-founder of Quiet Revolution and the author of the
  bestsellers *Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths of Introverted Kids,* and
  *Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking*, which has
  been translated into 40 languages and been on the *New York Times* bestseller
  list for more than four years.
* 12 I handed in a first draft after the first two years, which my editor
  (correctly) pronounced crappy. She put it only slightly more delicately. She
  said, "Take all the time you need, start from scratch, and get it right." I
  left her office elated - because I agreed with her.

### Kyle Maynard
* 14 Kyle Maynard is a best-selling author, entrepreneur, and ESPY award-winning
  mixed martial arts athlete, known for becoming the first quadruple amputee to
  reach the summits of Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Aconcagua without the aid of
  prosthetics.
