### Ambition's Debt
* 238 Confinity and X.com internal conflict was not known to the board until the
coup was planned to boot Elon from the CEO position by Max, Thiel and others
* 242 Elon following the successful coup: "It's easy to be bitter and hate them
forever, But the best course of action is to turn the other cheek and make the
reltionship good. And I put a lot of effort into making things good."
* 247 Elon also said that taking a vacation at such a tumultuous time was a bad
idea, if he was there it may not have happened: "Some combination of reassurance
and fear would not have resulted in a coup, I think"
