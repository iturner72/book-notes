### Introduction
* xii If you have used the internet at all in the last twenty years, you''ve
    touched a product, service, or website connected to the creators of PayPal.
    The founders of several of our era's defining firms -- the creators of
    YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, and Palantir, among others -- were
    early PayPal employees; others occupy top posts at Google, Facebook, and
    Silicon Valley's leading venture capital firms.
* xii As a group, thy constitute one of the most powerful and successful
    networks ever created -- power and influence captured in the controversial
    phrase the "PayPal Mafia," Several billionaires and many multimillionairs
    have emerged from PayPal's ranks; the group's combined net worth is higher
    than the GDP of New Zealand.
* xv ...PayPal's was an iconoclastic culture. Its earliest hires included high
    school drop-outs, ace chess players, and puzzle champions--often chosen
    because of their eccentricities and peculiarities, not in spite of them.
* xvi After nearly endless setbacks--a brutal merger, tens of millions of
    dollars lost to fraud, and a tough climate for technology stocks--PayPal
    pulled off the improbable: a stunningly successful IPO, and its acquisition,
    the same year, by eBay for $1.5 billion.

## Part 1: Sicilian Defense

### 1 Building Blocks
* 5 "My standard self-definition as a programmer had always been that I started
    with these decrepit computers," Levchin said. "Iw was all...very procedural
    programming in various different assembly languages...[It] probably made me
    slightly more elitist, but certainly made me very tenacious as a developer.
    I never really had an option to take the easy way out, I guess."
* 12 ...Nosek and Banister gave Levchin a crash course on libertarianism. The
    two had codounded a libertarian student group, and Banister coded the
    group's website. Together they tried to indoctrinate Levchin, encouraging
    him to attend various libertarian events and read books like Ayn Rand's *The
    Fountainhead* and Friedrick Hayek's *The Road to Serfdom*.
* 14 "I remember once coming over to her house and, right when I got there,
    going into the bathroom to write code." Knocking on the dorr his girlfriend
    asked, "What are you even doing here?" "What? We're dating," he replied,
    confused at the question. "No, this is not dating. You are coding in my
    bathroom."

### 2 The Pitch
* 28 Thiel posed a question early on the Levchin: *Take any positive integer.
    Some have an odd number of unique divisors, and some have an even number of
    unique divisors. Describe the subset of all z integers that have exactly an
    even number of divisors.*
    * Answer: Find the number of perfect squares less than *z* and subtract that
        number from*z*-1.
* 28 Levchin asked back: *Imagine you have two ropes of variable density. If you
    set either rope on fire, despite burning at varying speeds, it will be
    entirely gone in one hour. Using the two ropes, measure exactly 45 minutes.*
    * Answer: Simultaneously light both ends of one rope and one end of the
        other rope, The first rope will burn out in 30 minutes. When it does,
        light the unlit end of the other rope. When the second rope burns out,
        45 minutes will have passed.

### 3 The Right Questions
* 45 In February 1999, Zip2 sold to Compaq Computer for $307 million in cash...
    For Musk, the purchase meant a $21 million payday.
* 46 "My bank account went from, like, %5,000 to $21,005,000," he said. He was
    twenty-seven years old. With his fresh millions, Musk bought himself a condo
    in Palo Alto and a $1 million McLaren F1 sports car.

### 4 What Matters to Me is Winning
* 49 Musk's critique extended even to seemingly vital funancial infrastructure
    like stock exchanges: "I said, 'Well, why don't we just allow people to
    trade with each other? So if I want to send you stick, why don't I just send
    you a share of whtever?' I don't need to go through anything. The exchange
    is unnecessary."
* 53 Musk rolled much of his Zip2 windfall into X.com, investing $12.5 million
    and purchasing the X.com domain with personal funds.
* 59 He'd arrive at the X.com office early -- the financial marketsopened at
    6:30 a.m. PST, by which time Fricker would already be hard at work. By
    contrast, Musk would regularly conclude his work day at thee or four in the
    morning with a catnap on his office floor -- just hours before Fricker would
    arrive.

### 5 The Beamers
* 72 "A successful and aggressive leveraging of the e-finance platform could
    turn Confinity into a global financial institution, offering a complete
    suite of customer banking services. Under this scenario, Confinity would
    push all the way to an IPO."
* 78 Picture the scene: A few technophiles are at lunch in Palo Alto. The check
    arrives, and the onerous task of dividing up the bill begins. One diner
    reminds the group that they have PalmPilots, which include a calculator and
    Confinity's money-beaming software. Presto: debts beamed, tab divided.
* 79 In February 1999, Levchin attended the International Financial Cryptography
    Association conference. Hosted in Anguilla, a sliver of a Caribbean island,
    the annual gethering drew the leading players in academic cryptography and
    digital currencies. (To this day Thiel, who attended the 2000 conferece,
    harbors a theory that Satoshi Nakamoto -- the mysterious founder of the
    cryptocurrency Bitcoin -- was among the attendees.

### 6 Hosed
* 85 Scheduled for the morning of Friday, July 23, 1999, Levchin and the team
    pulled back-to-back all-nighters, double- and triple-checking code until
    just before the event. As the sun rose that Friday, Levchin realized he'd
    been wearing the same pair of pants several days in a row. *I need to change
    my pants*, he thought to himself. So Levchin got in his car, drove home, and
    swapped out pants. Pants upgraded, he raced to Buck's.
* 96 "We are living in the heaven of PalmPilots," observed Reid Hoffman, a
    Stanford friend of Thiel's and early Confinity board member, "and we could
    walk into every single restaurant and go to each table and ask how many
    people have PalmPilots." He guessed the answer was between zero and one per
    restaurant. "And that means your use case can only be used between zero and
    one times, per restaurant, per meal cycle! You're hosed! It's over on this
    idea."
* 98 In hiring David Sacks, Thiel pulled rank and overruled the team's
    objections. This was a rare move for Thiel, who believed Sacks a rare
    candidate: After all, few people would come into an interview guns blazing
    *against* their prospective employer's flagship product. Thiel values
    bracing honesty, and he trusted that Sacks would speak candidly. "Peter
    said, 'I need people here I can scream at,'" Sacks remembered.

### 7 Money Talks
* 108 To Musk, money merely represented "[entries] in a database." X.com was
    just uniting the world's "entries" into one database---and cutting out the
    profit-seeking intermediaries. "My vision for [X.com]," Musk proclaimed,
    "was essentially the global center for all money."
* 117 In many ways, X.com was a prototypical Palo Alto start-up, but X.com did
    break with Silicon Valley orthodoxy in one critical respect: it used
    Microsoft products as the backbone of its technical architecture rather than
    building atop an open-source operating system like Linux.
* 119 In the summer of 1999, X.com's banking heavyweights tried to oust Mustk as
    CEO, then fled. Following their departures, the company's head count
    numbered in the low single digits.

## Part 2: Bad Bishop

### 8 If You Build It
* 128 Indeed, Musk was frustrated that X.com's other products didn't generate
    the same excitement. "We would shoe people the hard part--the agglomeration
    of financial services---and nobody was interested. Then we'd show people the
    email payments--which was the easy part--and everybody was interested," Musk
    explained in a 2012 commencement speech at CalTech. "So I think it's
    important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as
    closed-loop as possible."
* 130 Giacomo DiGrigoli, another product team member, remembered Sacks's
    frustration with one particular design. "[Sacks] was like, 'I do not
    understand why this is so complicated! This should be as easy as email!'"
    DiGrigoli recalled. Soon, a photo of David Sacks with the words "As Easy as
    Email!" graced the office walls.
* 135 Levchin even resisted helping the eBay user who had asked for assistance
    with the PayPal logo. "I definitely made some motions to prevent eBay
    growth," he said. He flirted with blocking the eBay URL from Confinity's
    servers outright.
* 142 Thiel abhorred bureaucracies, and now that Confinity was growing, he
    risked being ensnared by the very things he had abandoned upon leaving law
    firm life--management, paperwork, meetings. "Peter is even less tolerant of
    bullshit than I am," the famously administrivia-averse Musk remarked. "My
    bullshit tolerance is low, but Peter is like zero."

### 9 The Widget Wars
* 145 X.com and Confinity spent the turn of the twenty-first century locked in a
    tense battle for customer growth. THis contest consumed both companies from
    the end of 1999 through early 2000, driving employees and leaders alike to
    the brink and leaving lasting scars.
* 149 Levchin hung a banner in the office reading "Memento Mori" with an X.com
    logo. "Memento Mori" is an ancient Latin philosophical maxim which
    translates to "Remember that you must die."
* 150 Thiel determined that X.com could simply spend Confinity out of existence.
    "Peter was good to recognize that they were a real threat," Malloy said. And
    Thiel didn't like to lose. "Show me a good loser," Thiel once said to a
    Confinity employee, "and I'll show you a loser."
* 155 Eventually, the two sides reached a hard-won provisional agreement. While
    Confinity would remain the junior partner, what had begun as a 92-8
    acquisition had been hammered into aa 55-45 one.
* 156 Harris responded by dropping the bomb: he told Musk that absent a deal (50
    50 split) between the two companies, he would resign as X.com's CEO. Musk
    remembers saying, "'Bill, we need to raise a round. And you're basically
    putting a gun to my head.'"

### 10 Crash
* 158 In early 2000, Thiel and Musk were set to meet with Mike Moritz at
    Sequoia's office at 2800 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park to discuss the merger.
    Musk offered Thiel a lift from Palo Alto.
* 159 Thiel recalls the car in front of them coming fast into view--then Musk
    swerving to avoid it. The McLaren hit an embankment, was tossed into the
    air--"like a sicus," Musk remembered--then slammed violently into the
    ground. "The people that saw it happen thought we were goin to die," he
    recalled.
* 163 The joint company was on track to spend almost $25 million that quarter
    alone, with salaries, bonus payments, credit card fees, and fraud tearing
    through its balance sheet. "If we were standing on the roof of our building
    throwing wads of hundred-dollar bills over the side of the building,"
    remarked Reid Hoffman, "we'd be spending money less [quickly]."
* 170 Former employees point to the $100 million round's timing as a watershed
    for PayPal. "I don't think people know how precarious it was," Kement
    offered. "If we hadn't raised that $100 million round, there would be no
    PayPall."
* 170 Mark Woolway extended the counterfactual:" If the team hadn't closed that
    one humdred million," Woolway said, "there would be no SpaceX, no LinkedIn,
    and no Tesla."
* 171 Thiel presented a solution: the company should take the $100 million
    closed in March and transfer it to his hedge fund, Thiel Capital. He would
    then use that money to short the public markets. "It was abeautiful logic,"
    board membner Tim Hurd of MDP remembered. "One of the elements of PayPal was
    that they were untethered from how people did stuff in the real world."
* 171 Moritz "just lost his mind," a board member remembered, berating Thiel:
    "Peter, this is really simple: If this board approves that idea, I'm
    resigning!"
* 171 "The tide was changing and Peter is always pessimistic, but he recognizes
    it is changing, and he was definitely right," Malloy said. "We would have
    made more money [investing] than anything we did at PayPal."

### 11 The Nut House Coup
* 185 The Nut House meeting revealed overlap between Sacks and Musk where they
    had expected to be at odds. "By the time we left the Nut House that night,
    we realized everybody was on the same page about this," one participant
    said. "That is wan't working." That night, the assembled employees began
    plotting a putsch against their CEO.
* 191 "kind of by process of elimination, it was me," Musk recalled. "I wasn't
    planning to be CEO. It was kind of like, 'If I don't do it, when who is? And
    okay, Peter's not here. So, I guess I'll be CEO.'"

### 12 Buttoned-Up

(I had the idea to start taking notes on github when I was on page ~ 200, will
go back and fill in the previous chapters later)

### 14 Ambition's Debt
* 238 Confinity and X.com internal conflict was not known to the board until the
coup was planned to boot Elon from the CEO position by Max, Thiel and others
* 242 Elon following the successful coup: "It's easy to be bitter and hate them
forever, But the best course of action is to turn the other cheek and make the
relationship good. And I put a lot of effort into making things good."
* 247 Elon also said that taking a vacation at such a tumultuous time was a bad
idea, if he was there it may not have happened: "Some combination of reassurance
and fear would not have resulted in a coup, I think."


## Part 3: Doubled Rooks

### 15 Igor
* 257 Levchin was tasked with fixing the fraud problem. Millions of dollars were
trying to be taken; Max would eavesdrop on the Russian hacking rooms to get
important intel. He would call them up on the phone and speak to them in
Ukrainian.
* 257 Some fraudster cloned the PayPal site by making the PayPai.com url
* 258 In the early days fraudsters made bots to siphon the $10 and $20 bonuses that
Confinity offered as an incentive to use the payments network.
* 258 David Gausebeck suggested OCS (optical character recognition) could help stop
the bot problem. He suggested to Levchin "Why don't we put images of characters
and require a user to type them in? And that'll be hard to automate." He sent
this suggestion late in the evening and the next day in the office Max was halfway
through building it.
* 262 Levchin was not interested in hiring summer interns, he would just extend
full-time offers to college students. "Encouraged by its ability to best
top-tier universities for talent, the company placed an advertisement in
*The Stanford Daily* pushing students to quit school and join up."
* 263 A young 20 year old short-term employee help to investigate fraud and noticed
that fraudster's would fail to capitalize the first letter of the first name
for a fake account; this could be flagged by the fraud analysts.
* 264 Igor was a smart hacker who could pass the initial screening process, create
2 accounts and charge one from the other using a stolen credit card.
* 269 Freeza was a young kid who helped Levchin visualize the fraud data which won
him a MIT 35 under 35 list spot and an innovation award. They patented this
system under the name IGOR. Freeza tragically passed away of heart-failure at the age of 21.

### 16 Use The Force
* 271 Ebay employee mistakenly lumped buttons with sewing collectibles in
auction categories, communities savaged her on forums.
* 273 PayPal was terrified to launch the upsell update as it went against it's
always free ethos. They were right since users raged right after launch.
* 274 Turns out that the vocal minority who was raging was not too big of a deal
as 20% of the 30,000 people who had seen upsell page so far upgraded to a
fee-bearing account. Only 158 or 0.004% of users actually closed their accounts.
* 278 PayPal introduced a $500 limit (on credit card transactions every 6 months)
for free accounts to help with the credit card fees and fraud.
* 281 Huge milestone when payments from bank funded accounts matched those of
credit card funded ones.

### 17 Crime In Progress
* 285 Hackers Ivanov and Gorshkov were caught by the FBI and it was revealed that
they would use stolen credit cards and have bots bid on auctions with PayPal
accounts with losses of $1.5 million.
* 289 Word gets out real quick in the fraud community. "Okay, PayPal's arresting
people, so maybe think twice about it."
* 291 "At PayPal, any computer security issue was just absolutely and existential
threat."
* 291 In the world of digital security, no one could be trusted--not even the
company's founders and leaders.

### 18 Guerrillas
* 296 In Fall of 2000 the company had a $3 billion market cap as other tech
companies tanked.
* 296 Sacks wrote during this time: "As you mey know, ebay (in collusion with Visa)
has declared war on us by making Visa free to sellers..."
* 299 In late 2000, ebay was in a catch-22 w/ PayPal. Fees which went to PayPal
should be going to BillPoint, but PP was helping users complete and close transactions for ebay.
* 301 Buy It Now feature took customers away from PayPal by removing friction,
but it had so many bugs in the release that many returned to using PayPal.
* 302 Buy It Now eventually worked as the bugs got ironed out and ebay beat
Wall Street expectations third-quarter earnings
* 302 Rob Chestnut, an ebay attorney said of PayPal: "I'd say their competitors
were probably going home at six or seven o'clock at night, PayPal was just
wheeling in dinner at that poing...They were highly entrepreneurial, very
aggressive. you've got to admire that."
* 306 Sacks pushed for PayPal Shops in 2001 which helped users launch their own
site outside of ebay to build their own online businesses
* 308 "There were some sellers that didn't like giving eBay as much power over
their business as it had... [Using PayPa was an opportunity to be a little
more independent from ebay. 'eBay wants us to do A. Well, we're gonna do B.'"
* 311 New employee Keith Rabois was tasked with making a case for anti-trust
against ebay, this came after the US department of Justice sued Microsoft for
anticompetitive, monopolistic behavior in 1998.

### 19 World Domination
* 320 PayPal wanted to expand abroad but ran into some issues accepting currencies
other than USD, so they allowed foreign users to accept USD and one shop in
Thailand migrated 95% of their business from ebay to their own website using PayPal.
* 325 PayPal started getting involved in the online gambling industry but this
got tangled up with some money laundering schemes with cocaine dealers, hit men
and gun traffickers.
* PayPal would choose its conquests selectively. "World domination," Sacks
concluded, "will not be achieved by indiscriminately parachuting into hostile lands."

### 20 Blindsided
* 328 Thiel wanted to company to be profitable by August of 2001 so they could IPO.
Only 14% of companies achieved profitability prior to their IPOs in 2000. Peter
would die his hair blue if the company was able to reach this goal.
* 337 For I believe that the terrorists were not only evil and insane, but also
really stupid. One will not stop world trade by blowing up a big building,
even if it happens to be called the "World Trade Center."
* 340 ebay's Auction for America also required users to pay for their auctions
with Billpoint, squeezing PayPal out of the mix. ebay argues that the policy
ensured proper accounting and the accurate transferring of charitable dollars.
But sellers contended that ebay was using a charity effort as a cover to
increase Billpoint registration.
* 341 "After 911... The government--I'll just say 'the government'--came to us,
and they said, 'We do not understand how money is moving around the worls
electronically.' Because they were still kind of number-two pencil people...
And they were like, 'Can you help us?'"
* 342 Thiel's interest in Girard often led him to zig where others zagged--and
instinct that informed the IPO filing. "If you're in a world where no one goes
public," Thiel explained, "maybe paradoxically, that is the time to go public.
Because, you know, it's a positive counterpoint to the chaos or something."

### 21 Outlaws
* 349 Amazon's lawsuit and the one-click patent received widespread criticism,
including from tech pioneer Tim O'Reilly, who popularized terms like *open
source* and *Web 2.0*. "Patents such as yours are the first step in vitiating
the web, in raising the barriers to entry not just for your competitors, but
for the technological innovators who might otherwise come up with great new
ideas that you could put to use in your own business."
* 352 Thiel said to a Stanford audience: "We got the on [SEC examiner] who was
ideologically opposed to companies. He thought all companies in the US were run
by crooks and it was his hob as an SEC regulator to prevent companies from ever
going public."
* 361 "People doing keg stands," Jeremy Roybal recalled, "who have *clearly*
never done a keg stand before." Refering to the IPO celebration.
* 362 The public markets had valued PayPal at just shy of $1 billion.

### 22 And All I Got Was A T-Shirt
* 366 As ebay Live opened its doors, PayPal logos were everywhere, with attendees
wearing the shirts in the hopes of winning free cash.
* 376 In Whitman's defense, it's possible that nothing she said may have won
hearts and minds in that moment. She was speaking before an audience that, in
the heat of their competition against ebay's billpoint, had once constructed a
"Meg Whitman pinata."
* 380 "Sometimes we've said it feels like the entire world is really against
us... Well, it is!" Thiel began. "First, they thought the banks would put us
out of business. And when that didn't happen they said our customers would stop
using us. And when that didn't happen they called on the rest of the earth to
join them."

### Conclusion: The Floor
* 384 "But is was very obvious that no one at ebay wanted anyone at PayPal to
stay...and no one [from PayPal] had ambitions to stick around at the combined
company."
* 385 PayPal alumni did not hid their despleasure. One memorable display came
when ebay distributed plush mongooses tied to a company-wide emphasis on
setting smart goals. In the PayPal area of the company's offices, former PayPal
employees massacred their mongooses.
* 388 In 2002, PayPal had more than 10 million users in dozens of countries;
by 2010, it surpassed 100 million users in nearly every country in the world.
As of this writing, PayPal counts more than 250 million users and conducted
almost $1 trillion in transactions in 2020 alone.
* 390 Thus Paypal went public for the second time in mid-July 2015, thirteen
years after the announcement of its acquisition by ebay. As of this writing,
ebay's market cap on the Nasdaq is more than $40 billion. PayPal is today worth
more than $300 bilion--more than 300 times its 2002 IPO valuation.
* 396 "It's always unclear...what lessons to draw," Thiel explained, "because
you can't really run an experiment in one of these companies twice."
* 397 Levchin added an unexpected qualification for PayPal employees that he
felt contrubuted to the company's success and the later achievements of its
alumni: many of its earliest employees simply hated being employees. "The very
best employee at any job at any level of responsibility is the person who
generally believes that this is their last job working for someone. The next
thing they'll start will be their own," Levchin said. "Having as many people
like that as possible is what made the difference in the company, and it's what
made it such a fertile ground for entrepreneurs later on."
