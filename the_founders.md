### Introduction

### Butoned-Up

(I had the idea to start taking notes on github when I was on page 200, will
go back and fill in the previous chapters later)

### Ambition's Debt
* 238 Confinity and X.com internal conflict was not known to the board until the
coup was planned to boot Elon from the CEO position by Max, Thiel and others
* 242 Elon following the successful coup: "It's easy to be bitter and hate them
forever, But the best course of action is to turn the other cheek and make the
reltionship good. And I put a lot of effort into making things good."
* 247 Elon also said that taking a vacation at such a tumultuous time was a bad
idea, if he was there it may not have happened: "Some combination of reassurance
and fear would not have resulted in a coup, I think."


## Part 3: Doubled Rooks

### Igor
* 257 Levchin was tasked with fixing the fraud problem. Millions of dollars were
trying to be taken; Max would eavesdrop on the Russian hacking rooms to get
important intel. He would call them up on the phone and speak to them in
Ukrainian.
* 257 Some fraudster cloned the PayPal site by making the PayPai.com url
* 258 In the early days fraudsters made bots to siphon the $10 and $20 bonuses that
Confinity offered as an incentive to use the payments network.
* 258 David Gausebeck suggested OCS (optical character recognition) could help stop
the bot problem. He suggested to Levchin "Why don't we put images of characters
and require a user to tupe them in? And that'll be hard to automate." He sent
this suggestion late in the evening and the next day in the office Max was halfway
through building it.
* 262 Levchin was not interested in hiring summer interns, he would just extend
full-time offers to college students. "Encouraged by its ability to best
top-tier universities for talent, the company placed an advertisement in
*The Stanford Daily* pushing students to quit school and join up."
* 263 A young 20 year old short-term employee help to investiate fraud and noticed
that fraudster's would fail to capitalize the first letter of the first name
for a fake account; this could be flagged by the fraud analysts.
* 264 Igor was a smart hacker who could pass the initial screening process, create
2 accounts and charge one from the other using a stolen credit card.
