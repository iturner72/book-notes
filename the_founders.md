### Butoned-Up

(I had the idea to start taking notes on github when I was on page ~ 200, will
go back and fill in the previous chapters later)

### Ambition's Debt
* 238 Confinity and X.com internal conflict was not known to the board until the
coup was planned to boot Elon from the CEO position by Max, Thiel and others
* 242 Elon following the successful coup: "It's easy to be bitter and hate them
forever, But the best course of action is to turn the other cheek and make the
relationship good. And I put a lot of effort into making things good."
* 247 Elon also said that taking a vacation at such a tumultuous time was a bad
idea, if he was there it may not have happened: "Some combination of reassurance
and fear would not have resulted in a coup, I think."


## Part 3: Doubled Rooks

### 15 Igor
* 257 Levchin was tasked with fixing the fraud problem. Millions of dollars were
trying to be taken; Max would eavesdrop on the Russian hacking rooms to get
important intel. He would call them up on the phone and speak to them in
Ukrainian.
* 257 Some fraudster cloned the PayPal site by making the PayPai.com url
* 258 In the early days fraudsters made bots to siphon the $10 and $20 bonuses that
Confinity offered as an incentive to use the payments network.
* 258 David Gausebeck suggested OCS (optical character recognition) could help stop
the bot problem. He suggested to Levchin "Why don't we put images of characters
and require a user to type them in? And that'll be hard to automate." He sent
this suggestion late in the evening and the next day in the office Max was halfway
through building it.
* 262 Levchin was not interested in hiring summer interns, he would just extend
full-time offers to college students. "Encouraged by its ability to best
top-tier universities for talent, the company placed an advertisement in
*The Stanford Daily* pushing students to quit school and join up."
* 263 A young 20 year old short-term employee help to investigate fraud and noticed
that fraudster's would fail to capitalize the first letter of the first name
for a fake account; this could be flagged by the fraud analysts.
* 264 Igor was a smart hacker who could pass the initial screening process, create
2 accounts and charge one from the other using a stolen credit card.
* 269 Freeza was a young kid who helped Levchin visualize the fraud data which won
him a MIT 35 under 35 list spot and an innovation award. They patented this
system under the name IGOR. Freeza tragically passed away of heart-failure at the age of 21.

### 16 Use The Force
* 271 Ebay employee mistakenly lumped buttons with sewing collectibles in
auction categories, communities savaged her on forums.
* 273 PayPal was terrified to launch the upsell update as it went against it's
always free ethos. They were right since users raged right after launch.
* 274 Turns out that the vocal minority who was raging was not too big of a deal
as 20% of the 30,000 people who had seen upsell page so far upgraded to a
fee-bearing account. Only 158 or 0.004% of users actually closed their accounts.
* 278 PayPal introduced a $500 limit (on credit card transactions every 6 months)
for free accounts to help with the credit card fees and fraud.
* 281 Huge milestone when payments from bank funded accounts matched those of
credit card funded ones.

### 17 Crime In Progress
* 285 Hackers Ivanov and Gorshkov were caught by the FBI and it was revealed that
they would use stolen credit cards and have bots bid on auctions with PayPal
accounts with losses of $1.5 million.
* 289 Word gets out real quick in the fraud community. "Okay, PayPal's arresting
people, so maybe think twice about it."
* 291 "At PayPal, any computer security issue was just absolutely and existential
threat."
* 291 In the world of digital security, no one could be trusted--not even the
company's founders and leaders.

### 18 Guerrillas
* 296 In Fall of 2000 the company had a $3 billion market cap as other tech
companies tanked.
* 296 Sacks wrote during this time: "As you mey know, ebay (in collusion with Visa)
has declared war on us by making Visa free to sellers..."
* 299 In late 2000, ebay was in a catch-22 w/ PayPal. Fees which went to PayPal
should be going to BillPoint, but PP was helping users complete and close transactions for ebay.
* 301 Buy It Now feature took customers away from PayPal by removing friction,
but it had so many bugs in the release that many returned to using PayPal.
* 302 Buy It Now eventually worked as the bugs got ironed out and ebay beat
Wall Street expectations third-quarter earnings
* 302 Rob Chestnut, an ebay attorney said of PayPal: "I'd say their competitors
were probably going home at six or seven o'clock at night, PayPal was just
wheeling in dinner at that poing...They were highly entrepreneurial, very
aggressive. you've got to admire that."
* 306 Sacks pushed for PayPal Shops in 2001 which helped users launch their own
site outside of ebay to build their own online businesses
* 308 "There were some sellers that didn't like giving eBay as much power over
their business as it had... [Using PayPa was an opportunity to be a little
more independent from ebay. 'eBay wants us to do A. Well, we're gonna do B.'"
* 311 New employee Keith Rabois was tasked with making a case for anti-trust
against ebay, this came after the US department of Justice sued Microsoft for
anticompetitive, monopolistic behavior in 1998.

### 19 World Domination
* 320 PayPal wanted to expand abroad but ran into some issues accepting currencies
other than USD, so they allowed foreign users to accept USD and one shop in
Thailand migrated 95% of their business from ebay to their own website using PayPal.
* 325 PayPal started getting involved in the online gambling industry but this
got tangled up with some money laundering schemes with cocaine dealers, hit men
and gun traffickers.
* PayPal would choose its conquests selectively. "World domination," Sacks
concluded, "will not be achieved by indiscriminately parachuting into hostile lands."

### 20 Blindsided
* 328 Thiel wanted to company to be profitable by August of 2001 so they could IPO.
Only 14% of companies achieved profitability prior to their IPOs in 2000. Peter
would die his hair blue if the company was able to reach this goal.
* 337 For I believe that the terrorists were not only evil and insane, but also
really stupid. One will not stop world trade by blowing up a big building,
even if it happens to be called the "World Trade Center."
* 340 ebay's Auction for America also required users to pay for their auctions
with Billpoint, squeezing PayPal out of the mix. ebay argues that the policy
ensured proper accounting and the accurate transferring of charitable dollars.
But sellers contended that ebay was using a charity effort as a cover to
increase Billpoint registration.
* 341 "After 911... The government--I'll just say 'the government'--came to us,
and they said, 'We do not understand how money is moving around the worls
electronically.' Because they were still kind of number-two pencil people...
And they were like, 'Can you help us?'"
* 342 Thiel's interest in Girard often led him to zig where others zagged--and
instinct that informed the IPO filing. "If you're in a world where no one goes
public," Thiel explained, "maybe paradoxically, that is the time to go public.
Because, you know, it's a positive counterpoint to the chaos or something."

### 21 Outlaws
* 349 Amazon's lawsuit and the one-click patent received widespread criticism,
including from tech pioneer Tim O'Reilly, who popularized terms like *open
source* and *Web 2.0*. "Patents such as yours are the first step in vitiating
the web, in raising the barriers to entry not just for your competitors, but
for the technological innovators who might otherwise come up with great new
ideas that you could put to use in your own business."
* 352 Thiel said to a Stanford audience: "We got the on [SEC examiner] who was
ideologically opposed to companies. He thought all companies in the US were run
by crooks and it was his hob as an SEC regulator to prevent companies from ever
going public."
* 361 "People doing keg stands," Jeremy Roybal recalled, "who have *clearly*
never done a keg stand before." Refering to the IPO celebration.
* 362 The public markets had valued PayPal at just shy of $1 billion.

### 22 And All I Got Was A T-Shirt
* 366 As ebay Live opened its doors, PayPal logos were everywhere, with attendees
wearing the shirts in the hopes of winning free cash.
* 376 In Whitman's defense, it's possible that nothing she said may have won
hearts and minds in that moment. She was speaking before an audience that, in
the heat of their competition against ebay's billpoint, had once constructed a
"Meg Whitman pinata."
* 380 "Sometimes we've said it feels like the entire world is really against
us... Well, it is!" Thiel began. "First, they thought the banks would put us
out of business. And when that didn't happen they said our customers would stop
using us. And when that didn't happen they called on the rest of the earth to
join them."

### Conclusion: The Floor
* 384 "But is was very obvious that no one at ebay wanted anyone at PayPal to
stay...and no one [from PayPal] had ambitions to stick around at the combined
company."
* 385 PayPal alumni did not hid their despleasure. One memorable display came
when ebay distributed plush mongooses tied to a company-wide emphasis on
setting smart goals. In the PayPal area of the company's offices, former PayPal
employees massacred their mongooses.
* 388 In 2002, PayPal had more than 10 million users in dozens of countries;
by 2010, it surpassed 100 million users in nearly every country in the world.
As of this writing, PayPal counts more than 250 million users and conducted
almost $1 trillion in transactions in 2020 alone.
* 390 Thus Paypal went public for the second time in mid-July 2015, thirteen
years after the announcement of its acquisition by ebay. As of this writing,
ebay's market cap on the Nasdaq is more than $40 billion. PayPal is today worth
more than $300 bilion--more than 300 times its 2002 IPO valuation.
* 396 "It's always unclear...what lessons to draw," Thiel explained, "because
you can't really run an experiment in one of these companies twice."
* 397 Levchin added an unexpected qualification for PayPal employees that he
felt contrubuted to the company's success and the later achievements of its
alumni: many of its earliest employees simply hated being employees. "The very
best employee at any job at any level of responsibility is the person who
generally believes that this is their last job working for someone. The next
thing they'll start will be their own," Levchin said. "Having as many people
like that as possible is what made the difference in the company, and it's what
made it such a fertile ground for entrepreneurs later on."
