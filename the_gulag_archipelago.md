## Part I The Prison Industry

### 1 Arrest
* 8 Tou are arrested by a meterman who has come to read your electric meter. You
    are arrested by a bicyclist who has run into you on the street, by a railway
    conductor, a taxi driver, a savings bank teller, the manager of a movie
    theater. Any one of them can arrest you, and you notice the concealed
    maroon-colored identification card only when it is too late.
* 14 "Tou have..." he asked weightily, "a friend on the First Ukrainian Front?"
    "It's forbidden! You have no right!" the captain and the major of
    counterintelligence shouted at the colonel.

### 2 The History of Our Sewage Disposal System
* 19 *Before* it came the wave of 1929 and 1930, the size of a good River Ob,
    which drove a mere fifteen million peasants, maybe even more, out into the
    taiga and the tundra. But peasants are a slient people, without a literary
    voice, nor do they write complaints or memoirs.
* 23 True, they were supposedly being arrested and tried not for their actual
    faith but for openly declaring their convictions and for bringing up their
    children in the same spirit. As Tanya Khodkevich wrote: You can pray
    *freely* But just so Hod alone can hear. (She received a ten-year sentence
    for these verses.)
* 26 Like raging beasts, abandoning every concept of "humanity," abandoning all
    humane principles which had evolved through the millennia, the authorities
    began to round up the very best farmers and their families, and to drive
    them, stripped of their possessions, naked, into the northern wastes, into
    the tundra and the taiga.
* 26 There was even a wave for *snipping wars*, the nighttime snipping of
    individual ears of grain in the field...this bitter and not very productive
    occupation (an extreme of poverty to which the peasants had not been driven
    even in serfdom) the courts handed out a full measure: *ten* years for what
    ranked as an especially dangerous theft of socialist property.
* 35 ...on June 4, 1947, a decree was issued which outdid them all. It was
    instantly christened "Four-sixths" by the undismayed prisoners. If a young
    girl sent into the fields to get a few ears of grain took along two friends
    for company ("an organized gang") or some twelve-year-old youngsters went
    after cucumbers or apples, they were liable to get *twenty* years in camp.

### 3 The Interrogation
* 49 The interrogator, without sking one single question, and sometimes without
    even allowing Chebotaryev to sit down, would pick up the telephone: "Take
    away the prisoner from 107!" And so they came to get him and took him back
    to his cell. No sooner had he lain down on his board bunk than the lock
    rattled: "Chebotaryev! To interrogation. Hands behind your back!" And when
    he got there: "Take away the prisoner from 107!"
* 56 But neither our education, nor our upbringing, nor our experience perpares
    us in the slightest for the greatest trial of our lives: being arrested for
    nothing and interrogated about nothing.
