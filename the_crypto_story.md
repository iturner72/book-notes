# The Crypto Story

by Matt Levine

*I, Ian Turner added this article to my book-notes repo in order to reference
during the gm.xyz/C/OnTheBrink Book Club. I will pitch the idea of making this
document both a place for notes, and a docket for the conversation. I will
probably take more notes on the trad fi comments than the crypto ones since I am
very much ignorant of financial vocab, but above average with crypto concepts*



## Notes

### Intro
* Joel Weber proposes that he is perhaps wrong about crypto and encourages his
    readers to understand this new technology that is here to stay.

## 1 Ledgers, Bitcoin, Blockchains
### A. Life In Databases
* Modern life consists in large part of entries in databases.
* If you have money, what you have is an entry in your bank's database saying
    how much money you have. If you have a share of stock, what you have is
    generally an entry on a list - kept by the company or, more likely, some
    central intermediary (Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. DTCC). The DTCC owns
    most of the shares of most US companies on behalf of everyone else. If you
    own stock, what you have is an entry on DTCC's list entitling you to some of
    the shares DTCC holds, and it has an entry on a company's list of how many
    shares it owns.
* ...your ownership of that house is probably written down in some database; in
    the US this often means there's a record of your buying the house - your
    title - in a filing cabinet in the basement of some county clerk's office.
    (It's not a very *good* database.)
* We trust the keepers of the database
    + ...it means we have an abstract snse of trust in the broader system, the
        system of laws and databases and trust itself. It's a towering and
        underappreciated achievement of modernity that we mostly do trust the
        database-keepers, and that they mostly are trustworthy.
### B. What If You Don't Like It?
* i. Distrust
    + But we don't always trust them, and they're not always trustworthy.
    + There are banks you can't trust to hold your money for you and places
        where you can't trust the rule of law to regulate them.
    + There are governments you can't trust not to seize your money from the
        banks, or falsify election results, or change the property registry and
        take your house.
* ii. Composability
    + These databases aren't always very good. Lots of the banking system is
        written in a very old computer language called Cobol...
    + What if we rewrote all the databases from scratch, in modern computer
        languages using modern software engineering principles, with the goal of
        making them interact with one another seamlessly?
    + What if there was one database, and everyone ran it?
### C. Digital Cash
* Intro.
    + In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a method for everyone to run a
        database, thus inventing "crypto."
    + Satoshi invented "an electronic payment system based on cryptographic
        proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact
        directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party."
* i. Digression: What are you even reading? Why are you reading it? Why am I
    writing it?
    + When Satoshi invented Bitcoin, one Bitcoin was worth zero dollars: it was
        just an idea he made up. At its peak last November, on Bitcoin was worth
        more than $67,000, and the total value of all the crypto in circulation
        was something like $3 trillion.
    + Many people who got into crypto early got very rich very fast and were
        very annoying about it.
    + I didn't sit down and write 40,000 words to tell you that crypto is dumb
        and worthless and will now vanish without a trace. That would be an odd
        use of time. My goal here is not to convince you that crypto is building
        the furute and that if you don't get on board you'll stay poor. My goal
        is to convince you that crypto is interesting, that it has found some
        new things to say about some old problems, and that even when those
        things are wrong, they're wrong in illuminating ways.
    + ...then some vague theoretical musings like "Well, maybe we could build a
        social media network on web3?" (Shots fired at gm???)
