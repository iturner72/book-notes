## The Crypto Story

by Matt Levine

*I, Ian Turner added this article to my book-notes repo in order to reference
during the gm.xyz/C/OnTheBrink Book Club. I will pitch the idea of making this
document both a place for notes, and a docket for the conversation. I will
probably take more notes on the trad fi comments than the crypto ones since I am
very much ignorant of financial vocab, but above average with crypto concepts*



## Notes

### Intro
* Joel Weber proposes that he is perhaps wrong about crypto and encourages his
    readers to understand this new technology that is here to stay.

## 1 Ledgers, Bitcoin, Blockchains
### A. Life In Databases
* Modern life consists in large part of entries in databases.
* If you have money, what you have is an entry in your bank's database saying
    how much money you have. If you have a share of stock, what you have is
    generally an entry on a list - kept by the company or, more likely, some
    central intermediary (Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. DTCC). The DTCC owns
    most of the shares of most US companies on behalf of everyone else. If you
    own stock, what you have is an entry on DTCC's list entitling you to some of
    the shares DTCC holds, and it has an entry on a company's list of how many
    shares it owns.
* ...your ownership of that house is probably written down in some database; in
    the US this often means there's a record of your buying the house - your
    title - in a filing cabinet in the basement of some county clerk's office.
    (It's not a very *good* database.)
* We trust the keepers of the database
    + ...it means we have an abstract snse of trust in the broader system, the
        system of laws and databases and trust itself. It's a towering and
        underappreciated achievement of modernity that we mostly do trust the
        database-keepers, and that they mostly are trustworthy.
### B. What If You Don't Like It?
* i. Distrust
    + But we don't always trust them, and they're not always trustworthy.
    + There are banks you can't trust to hold your money for you and places
        where you can't trust the rule of law to regulate them.
    + There are governments you can't trust not to seize your money from the
        banks, or falsify election results, or change the property registry and
        take your house.
* ii. Composability
    + These databases aren't always very good. Lots of the banking system is
        written in a very old computer language called Cobol...
    + What if we rewrote all the databases from scratch, in modern computer
        languages using modern software engineering principles, with the goal of
        making them interact with one another seamlessly?
    + What if there was one database, and everyone ran it?
### C. Digital Cash
