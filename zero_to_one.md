## Zero to One

by Peter Thiel

*I, Ian Turner own this book and took these notes for my own learning, purchase

### Preface
* 1 Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not
    build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a
    search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network.
    If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them.
* 1 Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to *n*, adding
    more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go
    from 0 to 1.

### 1 The Challenge of the Future
* 4 Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: "What
    important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
* 8 Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited
    technological development, mostly confined to IT.
* 10 New technology tends to come from new ventures--startups. From the Founding
    Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild
    Semiconductor's "traightorous eight" in business, small groups of people
    bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.
