### Preface
* 1 Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not
    build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a
    search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network.
    If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them.
* 1 Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to *n*, adding
    more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go
    from 0 to 1.

### 1 The Challenge of the Future
* 4 Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: "What
    important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
* 8 Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited
    technological development, mostly confined to IT.
* 10 New technology tends to come from new ventures--startups. From the Founding
    Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild
    Semiconductor's "traightorous eight" in business, small groups of people
    bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.

### 2 Party Like It's 1999
* 16 Dot-com mania was intense but short--18 months of insanity from September
    1998 to March 2000. It was a Silicon Valley gold rusg: there was money
    everywhere, and no shortage of exuberant, often sketchy people to chase it.
* 18 We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time
    they reffered a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands on new customers
    and an exponential growth rate.
* 18 When we raised $100 million the next month, our lead investor took the
    *Journal's* back-of-the-envelope valuation as authoritative. (Other
    investors were in even more of a hurry. A South Korean firm wired us $5
    million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I
    tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.)
