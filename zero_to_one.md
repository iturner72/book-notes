## Zero to One

by Peter Thiel

*I, Ian Turner own this book and took these notes for my own learning, purchase
the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296*

### Preface
* 1 Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not
    build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a
    search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network.
    If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them.
* 1 Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to *n*, adding
    more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go
    from 0 to 1.

### 1 The Challenge of the Future
* 4 Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: "What
    important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
* 8 Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited
    technological development, mostly confined to IT.
* 10 New technology tends to come from new ventures--startups. From the Founding
    Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild
    Semiconductor's "traightorous eight" in business, small groups of people
    bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.

### 2 Party Like It's 1999
* 16 Dot-com mania was intense but short--18 months of insanity from September
    1998 to March 2000. It was a Silicon Valley gold rusg: there was money
    everywhere, and no shortage of exuberant, often sketchy people to chase it.
* 18 We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time
    they reffered a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands on new customers
    and an exponential growth rate.
* 18 When we raised $100 million the next month, our lead investor took the
    *Journal's* back-of-the-envelope valuation as authoritative. (Other
    investors were in even more of a hurry. A South Korean firm wired us $5
    million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I
    tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.)

### 3 All Happy Companies Are Different
* 24 In this book, we're not interested in illegal bullies or government
    favorites: bhy "monopoly," we mean the kind of company that's so good at
    what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a
    good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: it hasn't competed in
    search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself from
    Microsoft and Yahoo!
* 25 Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised
    on the accumilation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits
    get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: *if you want to
    create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity
    business.*
* 27 *global* advertising is a $495 billion market. So even if Google completely
    monopolized US search engine advertising, it would own just 3.4% of the
    global advertising market.
* 34 Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. *Monopoly is the
    condition of every successful business.*

### 4 The Ideology of Competition
* 37 Had I actually clerked on the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my
    entire career taking depositions or drafting other people's business deals
    instead of creating anything new. It's hard to say how much would be
    different, but the opportunity costs were enormous. All Rhodes Scholars had
    a great future in their past.
* 43 If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign
    of value, you're already more sane than most. The next chapter is about how
    to use a clear head to build a monopoly business.

### 5 Last Mover Advantage
* 48 Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the
    following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects,
    economies of scale, and branding.
* 56 Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to
    expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core
    progression--to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent
    markets--a part of their founding narrative.
* 57 But since we expanded the market for payments overall, we have Visa far
    more business than we took. The overall dynamic was net positive, unlike
    Napster's negative-sum struggle with the U.S. recording industry. As you
    craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition
    as much as possible.
* 58 being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along
    and unseats you. It's much better to be the *last* mover--that is, to make
    the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even
    decades of monopoly profits.

### 6 You Are Not A Lottery Ticket
* 63 Optimists welcome the future; pessimists fear it:
    * *Indefinite Pessimism* Even today pessimism still dominates huge parts of the
    world. An *indefinite pessimist* looks out onto a bleak future, but he has
    no idea what to do about it.
    * *Definite Pessimism* A *definite pessimist* believes the future can be known,
    but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. Perhaps surprisingly,
    China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place in the world today.
    * *Definite Optimism* To a *definite optimist*, the future will be better than
    the present if he plans and works to make it better. From the 17th century
    through the 1950s and '60s, definite optimists led the Western world.
    * *Indefinite Optimism* To an *indefinite optimist*, the future will be
        better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific
        plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design
        it concretely.
* 71 At no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real
    economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually *prefer* unlimited
    optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with
    Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end
    itself.
* 72 The philosophy of the ancient world was pessimistic: Plato, Aristotle,
    Epicurus, and Lucretius all accepted strict limits on human potential. The
    only question was how best to cope with our tragic fate.
* 74 Our ancestors sought to understand and extend the human lifespan. In the
    16th century, conquistadores searched the jungles of Florida for a Fountain
    of Youth. Francis Bacon wrote that "the prolongation of life" should be
    considered itw own branch of medicine--and the noblest.
* 75 Eroom's law--that's Moore's law backward--observes that the number of new
    drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved every nine years
    since 1950.
* 78 Actually, most everybody in the modern world has already heard an answer to
    this question: progress without planning is what we call "evolution." Darwin
    himself wrote that life tends to "progress" without anybody intending it.
* 81 A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery.
    You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and
    important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of
    Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

### 7 Follow The Money
* 86 Our results at Founders Fund illustrate this skewed pattern: Facebook, the
    best investment in our 2005 fund, returned more than all the others
    combined. Palantir, the second-best investment, is set to return more than
    the sum of every other investment aside from Facebook.
* 90 The most common answer to the question of future value is a diversified
    portfolio: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket," everyone has been told.
    As we said, even the best venture investors have a portfoliom but investors
    who understand the power law make as few investments as possible.

### 8 Secrets
* 93 Every one of today's most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and
    unsuspected. The mathematical relationship between a triangle's sides, for
    example, was secret for millennia. Pythagoras had to think hard to discover
    it.
* 98 People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By
    definition, a secret hasn't been vetted by the mainstream. If your goal is
    to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn't look for secrets. The
    prospect of being lonely but right--dedicating your life to something that
    no one else believes in--is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and
    *wrong* can be unbearable.
* 106 So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there's
    always a golden mean between telling no-body and telling everybody--and
    that's a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is
    built around a secret that's hidden from the outside.

### 9 Foundations
* 108 When you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is
    whom to start it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and
    founder conflict is just as ugly as divorce.
* 112 ...it's crucial to choose wisely: every single member of your board
    matters. Even one problem director will cause you pain, and may even
    jeopardize your company's future. A board of three is ideal. Your board
    should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held.
* 113 Whenever an entrepreneur asks me to invest in his company, I ask him how
    much he intends to pay himself. A company does better the less it pays the
    CEO--that's one of the single clearest patterns I've noticed from investing
    in hundreds of startups. *In no case should a CEO of an early-stage,
    venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per year in salary*.
* 115 Startups don't need to pay high salaries because they can offer something
    better: part ownership of the company itself. Equity is the one form of
    compensation that can effectively orient people toward creating value in the
    future.
* 116 Sending out a company-wide email that lists everyone's ownership stake
    would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on your office.

### 10 The Mechanics of Mafia
* 118 Start with a thought experiment: what would the ideal company culture look
    like? Employees should love their work. They should enjoy going to the
    office so much that formal vusiness hours become obsolete and nobody watches
    the clock.
* 120 From the start, I wanted PayPal to be tightly knit instead of
    transactional. I thought stronger relationships would make us not just
    happier and better at work but also more successful in our careers even
    beyond PayPal. So we set out to hire people who would actually enjoy working
    together. They had to be talented, but even more than that they had to be
    excited about working specifically with us. That was the start of the PayPal
    Mafia.
* 123 The early PayPal team worked well together because we were all the same
    kind of nerd. We all loved science fiction: *Cryptonomicon* was required
    reading, and we preferred the capitalist *Star Wars* to the communist *Star
    Trek*.
* 123 The best thing I ded as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in
    the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee's one thing
    was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.
* 125 People at a successful startup are fanatically *right* about something
    those outside it have missed. You're not going to learn those kinds of
    secrets from consultants, and you don't need to worry if your company
    doesn't make sense to conventional professionals. Better to be called a
    cult--or even a mafia.

### 11 If You Build It, Will They Come?
* 131 SpaceX shows that it can be done. Within just a few years of launching his
    rocket startup. Elon Musk persuaded NASA to sign billion-dollar contracts to
    replace the decommissioned space shuttle with a newly designed veddel from
    SpaceX.
* 139 Nerds might wish that distribution could be ignored and salesmen banished
    to another planet. All of us want to believe that we make up our own minds,
    that sales doesn't work on us. But it's not true. Everybody has a product to
    sell--no matter whether you're an employee, a founder, or an investor. It's
    true even if your company consists of just you and your computer. Look
    around. If you don't see any sales-people, you're the salesperson.

### 12 Man And Machine
* 141 Everyone expects computers to do more in the future--so much more that
    some wonder: 30 years from now, will there be anything left for people to
    do? "Software is eating the world," venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has
    announced with a tone of inevitabillity.
* 144 As computers become more and more powerful, they won't be substitutes for
    humans: they'll be complements.
* 146 ...after we sold PayPal in 2002... The next year, I pitched Alex Karp, an
    old Stanford classmate, and Stephen Cohen, a softwae engineer, on a new
    startup idea: we would use the human-commputer hybrid approach from PayPal's
    security system to identify terrorist networks and financial fraud.
* 146 We already knew the FBI was interested, and in 2004 we founded Palantir, a
    software company that helps people extract insight from ivergent sources of
    information. The company is on track to book sales of $1 billion in 2014,
    and *Forbes* has called Palantir's software the "killer app" for its rumoed
    role in helping the goernment locate Osama bin Laden.
* 147 In addition to helping find terrorists, analysts using Palantir's software
    have been able to predict where insurgents plant IEDs in Afghanistan;
    prosecute high-progile insider trading cases; take down the largest child
    pornography ring in the world; support the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention in fighting foodborne disease outbreaks; and save both commercial
    banks and the government hundreds of millions of dollars annually through
    advanced fraud detection.

### 13 Seeing Green
* 164 An industry premised on the supposed twilight of fossil fuels was
    blindsided by the rise of fracking. In 2000, just 1.7% of America's natural
    gas came from fracked shale. Five years later, that figure had climbed to
    4.1%.
* 166 Tesla is one of the few cleantech companies started last decade to be
    thriving today. They rode the social buzz of cleantech better than anyone,
    but they got the seven questions right, so their success is instructive.
* 167 In January 2010--about a year and a half before Solyndra imploded under
    the Obama administration and politicized the subsidy question--Tesla secured
    a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. A half-billion
    dollar subsidy was unthinkable in the mid-2000s. It's unthinkable today.

### 14 The Founder's Paradox
* 173 Of the six people who started PayPal, four had built bombs in high school.
    Five were just 23 years old--or younger. Four of us had been born outside
    the United States. Three had ascaped here from communist countries: Yu
    Panfrom China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine.
* 173 The six of us could have been seen as eccentric. My first ever
    conversation with Luke was about how he'd just signed up for cryonice, to be
    frozen upon death in hope of medical resurrection.
* 183 Before she joined the club in 2011, Amy Winehouse sang: "They tried to
    make me go to rehab, but I said, 'No, no, no.'" Maybe rehab seemed so
    unattractive because it blocked the path to immortality. Perhaps the only
    way to be a rock god forever is to die an early death.
* 188 The lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should
    be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual
    individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism.
* 189 That we need individual founders in all their peculiarity does not mean
    that we are called to worship Ayn Randian "prime movers" who claim to be
    independent of everybody around them. In this respect Rand was a merely
    half-great writer: her villains ere real, but her heros were fake. There is
    no Galt's Gulch. There is no secession from society.

### Conclusion: Stagnation Or Singularity?
* 195 Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will
    make the future not just different, but better--to go from 0 to 1. The
    essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world
    anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can
    we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
